[Speaker 1 - Man]
Hello, Sharks, how are you? I'm León, and today I'm here to share how we managed to energize a completely static category. In January 2019, I received a job offer to work in Monterrey. This forced me to take a plane every week from Monterrey to Mexico City, and the constant was that on each flight, you could count 5 to 10 people carrying chicharrón (pork rinds) or meat. In the end, fate brought me together with who is now my partner, and we agreed that this business opportunity could be done right here in Mexico City and freshly made. So, in September 2019, we started El Chicharrón Norteño.

As of today, we sell in more than 30 restaurants in over 12 cities throughout Mexico, with chefs who have helped us develop specific dishes that they have included in their menus. Additionally, this visibility allowed a retailer that handles all its frozen animal protein to approach us and say, "I reviewed all the alternatives available in the market and want you to be my chicharrón supplier." This compelled us to set up a plant in Nuevo León where we are producing chicharrón for this client, but additionally, we are already starting to market it under our own brand.

Next, Sharks, we'd like you to taste the product so you can see what we are doing. I think this could be a success in the stadium, Amaury. Please. Both my partner and I believe that having access to your vision, strategy, and all this toolkit that you have can help us accelerate our business. And that's why today we are offering 10% of our company for one million pesos.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Let's talk about your sales to get an idea.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Last year, we closed at 6 million pesos. Last year was when we just started with this retailer part. Now this year, projecting a full year of sales, we are estimating closing this year at 15 million pesos.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
How are you going to take sales from 6 to 15 million pesos in one year?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Last year, we only sold to this client from September to December. Just with this impact of a full year, it helps us significantly grow the numbers.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
How much do you sell to that client per month?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
In pesos, about 500,000 pesos.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
500,000 pesos.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
And your team? You told us you had a partner who didn't come today.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Correct.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
How are you divided, and who else is part of your team?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
We are two partners, Leopoldo and me. Leopoldo is somewhat the capital part. He has 65% of the company; I have 35%; I'm the one who operates.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
You should have stayed 50-50. Even for an investor, the operator of the business having less than 50% of the business at this stage is complicated.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
León, sorry, I understood you have two business models: sales to boutique butcher shops.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Correct.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
And chefs. And restaurants.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
And end consumers.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
Ah, so you have three.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
That's right.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
That's what I was going to ask.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
How do you sell to the end consumer? Do you have physical locations?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
We realized that almost 85% of my sales were for pickup or delivery. So we decided to become a dark kitchen. Today we have a dark kitchen operating here in Mexico City, but there's also this whole model of franchise development. Today there are around 10 people interested in various cities in Mexico because they want to bring the El Chicharrón Norteño model.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Can we see the little box?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Of course.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
That's what I was going to ask about the boxes. Does it come frozen? Is it refrigerated?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
In retail, that's how you'll find it. It's frozen. The recommendation is that it stays frozen and has 12 months of shelf life when frozen. If you are an end consumer and order for delivery, I give it to you in a bag like the one we have here on the counter.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
And how much does one of those boxes cost to the public?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Retail price: my recommendation to my clients is 230 pesos, but some sell it for up to 250.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
And you sell it to them for?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
I sell it to them at 170 pesos.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
170? And it costs you?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Around 135.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
León, I'm going to be very, very frank and straightforward. It's not a product or business that aligns with my business ethics, and therefore I'm out.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Thank you very much.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
If you're ever interested in a concession at the stadium, reach out to me; I'd be happy to discuss it.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Absolutely, I'll take you up on that. Thank you very much.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
León, I mean, you're looking for contacts in the butcher industry, and I wouldn't even know where to start.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Okay.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
That's why I'm out.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Thank you very much.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
I don't eat chicharrón. I'm not into these kinds of products at all. I like to invest and try things, not just help place the product but also improve recipes or make things tastier. And I don't see myself trying it or distinguishing it because it's not, I have no expertise in this particular flavor and product. And for those reasons, I'm out.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Thank you very much.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
León, what are you going to use the one million pesos you're asking for?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Beyond seeking the money, what we really want is to have these kinds of conversations and be able to approach you. Where we are now is in this process of the TIF and HACCP plant; we need more refrigerated rooms. We need epoxy floors, expensive equipment. Basically, that's where the investment goes. But the reality is that beyond that, it's the opportunity to work with people like you.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
I usually invest in these kinds of food products, direct-to-consumer products, or mass-consumer products where I can contribute some of my experience. Calories don't scare me. The nutritional value, that it's fried, absolutely nothing. But this product makes me feel remorse.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Okay.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Because of the pigs.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Okay.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Thinking that I'm investing in a product that is sending many pigs to the slaughterhouse doesn't excite me at all, nor would it make me proud of myself.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
I see.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
The future is not this. That's why I'm out.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Thank you.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
León, I love the packaging, I love the brand, I love the displays. I love the mystique you're building around it. It seems that with you at the helm, it's a business that can go very far. But I didn't try the product because I don't eat pork. It would be inconsistent for me to invest in a mono-product company whose product I don't eat. But I'd love to see when you do a product line expansion where you're going to take this. And I'd love to talk with you later. That's why I'm out.
