Hello, sharks. My name is Ricardo Ávila, and I am the CEO of HDM Biotec. HDM Biotec is a biotechnology company, and we sell products for the agricultural sector to generate income. All our products are based on beneficial microorganisms that are natural enemies of pests and diseases. This helps us reduce the need for agrochemicals in the cultivation cycle. At HDM Biotech, we have a formulation patent that demonstrates that our formulas are unique and innovative. We began our journey in 2016, and it wasn't until December 2021 that we could enter the market. In 2022, we achieved sales of around half a million pesos, and so far in 2023, we've reached over three million pesos. Today, I come to invite you to be part of this green re-revolution, for which we are requesting an investment of five million pesos for 5% of our company.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Where do you sell your product, Ricardo?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Currently, we reach producers directly. The purchase volume depends on the area they manage.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Approximately how much does it cost? It's a one-liter container, I imagine, right?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
They are one-liter containers. The price is 450 pesos to the public. Distributors get about 30%, and we sell to distributors at 350 or 330 pesos.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
And how much does it cost you to manufacture it?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
It costs me between 100 and 120 pesos.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
Ricardo, let's see, I just want to make sure I understood correctly. You're asking for five million pesos for 5%?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
That's right.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
For me, there's a giant elephant in the room here. That gives me a valuation of 100 million pesos.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
That's correct.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
Let's say you could sell 10 million pesos this year; that gives me a valuation of 10 times sales. It's a valuation as if you were a technology company. I want to understand where you got that valuation from.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Because we are a biotechnology company. We use the products to finance ourselves, but the technological base we have is in the development of the products. Here we have three different products. Our patent is on the formulation. That being said, we can create products from our formulation, which can be fungi, bacteria, or mixtures.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
Ricardo, all of this is incredible, but how much are you going to sell in five years?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
I hope to be selling at least 30000 liters per month.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
Meaning, revenue per year?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
About 90 million pesos or more.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
Ricardo, let me see if I understood correctly. Is this a natural pesticide, or do we not even call it a pesticide?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
No, it cannot be considered a pesticide because "pesticide" refers to agrochemicals. These are biological control tools that are natural enemies of pests and diseases.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Tell us, how much have you invested to date in this company?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
About 20 million pesos and ten years.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Wow!

[Karla Berman - Woman]
I think the future sounds good, but the present is that you have a product that is a consumer product. I cannot justify this valuation. I'm out.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Thank you very much.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
Ricardo, besides congratulating you, I want to ask you to go somewhere to work with us. I want to thank you because fertilizers and pesticides are some of the major pollutants destroying the planet. Work like yours is the kind that will change the world. What is very clear is that you have an area of opportunity in your commercial aspect. The mere fact of how you valued your company already tells us there's room for improvement there. You're valuing your company very, very high. It's not only about having a good product; execution is also very important. And in that sense, since I think you need help in the commercial part, I don't believe I'm the partner you're looking for. For those reasons, I'm out, but I wish you much success.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Thank you very much, thank you very much.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Do you have a partner or partners?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
It's a family company. The first one who believed in us was my father, and from there, with all the work we've done, everything we earn and generate, we reinvest it.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
I have to say that you are a champion.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Thank you very much.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
You're doing something that will support the environment, that will support the farmers and food producers of our country and other countries. I'm truly impressed. It seems to me that one of the reasons you're valuing your company at 100 million pesos is because you feel you need these 5 million pesos right now. I don't feel that you need 5 million pesos now. What you need is to grow your sales area. Maybe don't seek so much money; start with the commercial part. For now, I'm out.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
You know, when you started talking, I began to get excited about the product, I got excited about your knowledge. And I completely deflated when you mentioned the valuation. It's very difficult at such an early stage in a company to ask for a valuation of this type. And that's why I'm out.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Thank you very much.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
I also think it's a great project. And something I really liked was that you dedicated several years to research. Very few companies, very few entrepreneurs, are willing to dedicate many years. And you already have that; your whole family has earned that space, and I congratulate you for that.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Thank you very much.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
And I'm sorry that, if you notice, all five of us thought you were a great entrepreneur, enthusiastic. We thought your product was wonderful, and you lost us because of the valuation. I'm out.
