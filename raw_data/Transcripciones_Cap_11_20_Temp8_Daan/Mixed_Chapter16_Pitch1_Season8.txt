Hello sharks, my name is Gabriela Villarreal and this is my handsome husband, Gerardo Robles, and we are Bimex Organics. We are a small company dedicated to the cultivation of Persian limes and the production of dehydrated lime juice powder. The reality is that using lime powder has many advantages. You can standardize the flavor of lime juice, avoid losses and waste, reduce labor in the preparation of some foods, and it also offers storage and transportation advantages, which can help achieve significant cost savings.

[Speaker 2 - Man]
To visualize it better, we have the 250-gram package, which is equivalent to 5 kilos of limes. We have the 500-gram package, which equals 10 kilos of limes. And we have the 25-kilogram sack, equivalent to half a ton of limes. The advantage of this product is that being dehydrated, it has a shelf life of over 18 months.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
I tried the powder just like that.

[Brian Requarth - Man]
Yes, me too.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Yes, and taking advantage of the fact that you're trying it, I'd like to mention that our product is made with juice from fresh limes from our own crops. It's a healthy product, it's 100% natural, free of warning labels, and contains only one ingredient, which is lime juice. Also, being a concentrate, it has a higher vitamin C content.

[Speaker 2 - Man]
We are seeking an investment of 200000 pesos in exchange for 10% equity.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
Hey, a question about the process.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Sure.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
I understand that to make something into powder, it's better to lyophilize.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
It's not freeze-dried. It's another process that we can't patent, but I think that's our advantage.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
Don't you lose properties in the dehydration process you use?

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
In fact, the lime retains all its nutritional properties.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
The company's name is Bimex Organics. Is this product classified as a certified organic product?

[Speaker 2 - Man]
Not yet. We are in the process of certification. The truth is, we started in 2015 because we marketed organic fertilizers. And from there, this project to begin organic cultivation was born. All our limes are 100% organic. We only apply organic products, but we are still in the certification process.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Tell us a bit more about your numbers. Tell us your costs, how you sell it, per kilo, how much it costs you.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
The cost is 95 pesos for the 250-gram bag. Our retail price is 195 pesos, and the price we give to the distributor is 142.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Since when have you been selling?

[Speaker 2 - Man]
We started operations six months ago.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Oh, okay.

[Speaker 2 - Man]
And we've made sales of 134000 pesos with a net profit of 40%. It should be mentioned that we just closed a contract with a major retail chain, and we are about to start with them in four stores in the state of Puebla.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
How much are you going to sell this year?

[Speaker 2 - Man]
We have projected sales of 600000 pesos, also with a 40% profit, now with the entry into the retail chain.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
There's something that worries me a bit, which is, what about competition? Do you know the competition, and what advantages do you have over them?

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Okay, we haven't seen any product on the market that contains only one ingredient. Usually, they add vitamin C, silicon dioxide, anti-caking agents, etc.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
So the differentiator is the natural aspect.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
It's the flavor; it could be the variety of lime we're using because it's Persian lime. And also the process, because our process preserves its nutritional properties, which is an advantage. There's no need to add vitamin C.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
Gerardo, Gabriela, I have a conflict because you know that I sell multivitamins, I sell vitamins that have a lot of vitamin C, which are of natural origin and are also powders. So I know a lot about this, and I don't want to confuse my people with a similar product. That's my conflict. I'm going to wait to see if any shark makes you an offer, and I'll think a little about the flavor.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Thank you. Thank you.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
I really like the product; I think it can have many uses that perhaps we're not even seeing right now. But what I didn't like is that your growth plan is still very focused on lime. I don't know if I'd like to invest in a project where I don't see many growth possibilities. Maybe if I saw that in the future it's not just lime juice but you plan to make these types of products with other fruits, I would have been interested. But since I don't see that, for now, I'm out, but I'm going to try the product and hope to be your customer.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Thank you very much, Ale.

[Brian Requarth - Man]
At first, when I saw it, I was like, no, that's not for me. I tried the product; it does taste more natural than I thought. Although in this case, well, I think I'm going to have to be bitter with you. Yes. Yes, I'm out. And I'll tell you why. I love lime, but it's not the thing for me in terms of my taste and knowledge. So that's why I'm out.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Okay. Thank you very much, Brian.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
The fact that you come with something very novel, very different, which I congratulate you for, but that has a part involving habits that are very difficult to change and that it's not something 100% natural for me; there's nothing like the natural. When I tried it, personally, I didn't like it that much. So, for those reasons, because I didn't like the taste that much, because I promote the natural a lot, and because it's difficult to change habits, I'm out.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Thank you, Marisa.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
Gabriela, Gerardo, I think I've already thought about it. The truth is that I do think I have a conflict of interest with your product. Maybe if Marisa had been interested in buying this, I would have said, well, there's an interesting channel there for Marisa's products that are looking for alternatives, but she already made it clear that she is still seeking the natural flavor. I don't doubt that you have something. I do think you can adjust it and perfect it, especially the image, because that's where your challenge is. However, I'm out on this occasion, wishing you much success.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Thank you, Amaury.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
I think you do have competition. You have competition. You have strong competition. Indeed, you're missing many things, and the packaging can be improved, etc., etc. And I understand, from what you said, that you're inviting us into the company that has the orchard and the assets and all that. Is that correct?

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Yes.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
Your valuation is very high. It's very high for where you are right now and even for what you expect to sell. However, it's a product where I think I can help you. But I'm going to make you an offer that I don't know if you'll like, and in fact, in advance, I recommend that you think about it. I offer you the money you came to ask for, but for 25% of the company.

[Speaker 2 - Man]
Marcus, if we could lower it to 20% and you allow us to return that 200000 pesos so you can keep 15%, what do you think?

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
So, after you ask us for money, there will be a buyback of the shares?

[Speaker 2 - Man]
Uh-huh, of 5%, if you would allow us.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
And we'll define the valuation later and everything?

[Speaker 2 - Man]
Yes.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
Alright, do we have a deal?

[Speaker 2 - Man]
We have a deal.
