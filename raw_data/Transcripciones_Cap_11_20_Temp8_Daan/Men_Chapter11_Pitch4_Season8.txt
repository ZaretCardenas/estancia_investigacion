[Speaker 1 - Male]
Hello, sharks. My name is Julio Magaña. I'm from the city of Guadalajara, and I'm a partner and general director of Report Now. We are a Mexican company that develops solutions based on tracking and location technology. A few years ago, we decided to focus on problems that no one else was addressing in all of Mexico through this technology: electronic bracelets, geolocators for people with protective measures, "Pulse of Life," a program currently implemented in more than 20 governments that helps combat gender-based violence. Now we even have physical alert modules in cities, all connected directly to authorities. Today, I am offering 5% of Report Now in exchange for an investment of 3250000 pesos. I'd like you to see a bit of how this tracking technology works. Karla, you have a device called "Pulse of Life" at your place. This is our platform. Could you press the button for 4 seconds, please? In a few seconds, the alert arrives in real time, with the location, who is pressing that button, and the authorities also receive a call on specific phones for this program. Karla, are you okay?

[Karla Berman - Female]
Yes.

[Speaker 1 - Male]
A bidirectional communication channel opens where authorities can monitor everything happening around Karla, and at that moment, they decide whether or not to activate the emergency protocol assigned to that authority.

[Marisa Lazo - Female]
Julio, tell us a bit about your sales.

[Speaker 1 - Male]
In 2020, we invoiced approximately 10,200,000 pesos. In 2021, we grew almost double with 19,500,000 pesos. And in 2022, we again grew almost double, invoicing 37,200,000 pesos.

[Marisa Lazo - Female]
Approximately how much profit do you have left?

[Speaker 1 - Male]
On average, across all our solutions, in 2020 we had approximately a 25% profit. In 2021, approximately 35%. And in 2022, we increased a bit, almost reaching 40%.

[Marisa Lazo - Female]
Can your clients be the government?

[Speaker 1 - Male]
Specifically for this "Pulse of Life" solution, it's focused on government. Today, in addition to the technology, when a government acquires the program, we train the monitor operator, we train the field personnel, and we already have training in psychological first aid, among many others that need to be trained for this to continue working.

[Karla Berman - Female]
Julio, what percentage of your sales, of these 37 million, comes from the government? What percentage comes from companies, and what percentage comes from individuals?

[Speaker 1 - Male]
Approximately 60% currently comes from governments; the rest is from the private sector.

[Marcus Dantus - Male]
Julio, did you develop this device?

[Speaker 1 - Male]
No. We develop software and integrate devices from many parts of the world, depending on the solution we want to provide.

[Karla Berman - Female]
What results have there been, specifically, in reducing violence against women thanks to this?

[Speaker 1 - Male]
Several phenomena occur, Karla. As such, I don't have the data on how many women or how much the violence has decreased.

[Marcus Dantus - Male]
No, but you did say 4000 people benefited.

[Speaker 1 - Male]
At least 4000 people have received help with our technology. This technology is assigned to people who have a protective measure. After three months, if they do not renew that protective measure, the government withdraws the device and provides it to another person who needs it.

[Marisa Lazo - Female]
For many women, it has been a great relief, because it's very difficult. So many women, sadly, who are threatened and in danger, you can't assign a police officer outside each of their homes, but you can give them a device like this.

[Alejandra Ríos - Female]
The statistic is that 11 women die daily due to gender-based violence.

[Marisa Lazo - Female]
This is an enormous relief. It's something incredibly serious and incredibly sad.

[Marcus Dantus - Male]
Hey, Julio, but you had a net profit of over 15 million pesos last year. Why do you need three more?

[Speaker 1 - Male]
I wanted to give the company a fair value, I think, to also be able to have your experience.

[Karla Berman - Female]
Look, I really like your company.

[Speaker 1 - Male]
Thank you.

[Karla Berman - Female]
You have a product that we've seen works, you have very good margins, and I really like the valuation. But I don't want your company to have to exist. I want to be able to live in a country where women aren't afraid to go out.

[Alejandra Ríos - Female]
That reality is very far from being.

[Marisa Lazo - Female]
Very.

[Karla Berman - Female]
I know. But I can't be behind a company that, truly, in my heart, I want to have to cease to exist.

[Speaker 1 - Male]
Of course.

[Alejandra Ríos - Female]
But, Karla, obviously we want it not to exist, but we need it to exist. We need these companies.

[Marisa Lazo - Female]
Of course.

[Alejandra Ríos - Female]
That generate these types of solutions to protect the women of this country.

[Karla Berman - Female]
I know, and as a user perhaps yes, but as an investor, I'm out.

[Speaker 1 - Male]
Thank you, Karla.

[Amaury Vergara - Male]
Julio, I'm in a position similar to Karla's. I understand the product and think it's good, but in terms of this industry, and me seeing myself selling your product to authorities or companies, I don't feel so connected because I have a conflict of values where I wouldn't like to contribute to part of a solution when I feel that I'm focused on making root changes.

[Speaker 1 - Male]
Yes, yes, of course.

[Amaury Vergara - Male]
For those reasons, I'm out.

[Speaker 1 - Male]
Thank you.

[Marisa Lazo - Female]
I, Julio, differ from Amaury and Karla because I think it's a reality that sadly won't be solved in the coming years. And those women who now feel more at ease, for me, that was already worth it. Sadly, I'm not the shark expert in technology to grow your business, and for that reason, I'm out.

[Speaker 1 - Male]
Thank you.

[Amaury Vergara - Male]
But they say yes, that they're criticizing what we say and don't invest.

[Marisa Lazo - Female]
But they need experience.

[Karla Berman - Female]
Yes, hey, they turned against us.

[Alejandra Ríos - Female]
The reason Marisa is stepping out is very different from the reason you two did. One is, "I don't want to be related to this business because it doesn't align with my professional ethics." Marisa is saying, "I have nothing to contribute to you." It's very different. Julio, I love what you're doing. I think you don't need the money, but you do need advice, mentorship, and experience. I offer you my mind, my heart, my passion in whatever I can help you with. I'm out as an investor, but I'm in as an advisor, mentor, and whatever you need.

[Speaker 1 - Male]
Thank you very much.

[Marisa Lazo - Female]
I also join Alejandra; I love her offer. Count on me. In whatever I can help you, I'd love to.

[Speaker 1 - Male]
Thank you very much, Marisa.

[Marcus Dantus - Male]
There's something that doesn't add up. I don't understand why an entrepreneur who sells 40 million pesos and earns 15 doesn't seek advice or mentorship or add people to his board and comes for an amount much less than his profits. I mean, there's something in the model that I don't like either. There are some ideas I have that I'm happy to share, but for that reason, I'm out.
