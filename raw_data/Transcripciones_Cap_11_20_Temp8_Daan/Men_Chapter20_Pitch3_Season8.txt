Hello, sharks. We are Sierra Jabalí. We make forged knives in Monterrey, Nuevo León.

[Speaker 2 - Man]
My name is Benjamín Villarreal.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Mauricio Flores, my name.

[Speaker 2 - Man]
Our story begins in 2020, after being locked up for several months with absolutely nothing to do, we were just bored. So it occurred to us, the same thing that always occurs to us in Monterrey: grilling meat, right? The only thing there was to do. Then I met Mauricio, and we started teaming up to develop a line of forged knives made for grilling. Our target is the grill master. Why? Well, because all grill masters like to show off.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
We have several styles of knives for different cuts: filleting, butcher knives, for butchering, for skinning. We sell them as individual pieces. Each piece comes with its individual sheath, but also in kits. There are sets of three and five pieces. Both come with a honing steel, which we also make. People choose the pieces they like according to their individual needs.

[Speaker 2 - Man]
Yes, what we realized is that it's not the same to show up at a barbecue and pull out just any equipment as it is to arrive with your roll of three and have all your complete gear. Before you even start putting the meat on, they say, "This guy is going to throw down a very good cut." So yes, that's our idea, that people see and say, "This is appropriate for what's going to be done," let's say.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
What we're here to ask for, sharks, is 390000 pesos for 5% of the company.

[Speaker 2 - Man]
I'd like to give you a forging demonstration so you can see the method we use and what sets us apart from most people. So here goes.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
That's it. Come on. Oh, my God.

[Speaker 2 - Man]
The reason the metal has to be extremely hot is because if it's not hot, it won't move. And we only have a few seconds to strike it. So the skill of the blacksmith, the forger, is very important to know where you're going to hit and how fast you are. Because if not, you just stare at it, and the opportunity flies away. Let's see. Once the shape of the knife is forged, you use different parts of machinery, or you can do the refining manually, that's what we do. Usually, we use the big machines to move quickly and then move to the manual anvil, as you saw with the hammer and tongs, to give it the final shape. Right now, what you're going to see is the tempering. Tempering is a crucial part so that it keeps its edge but at the same time doesn't break. And there you have it, a quick demonstration. Obviously, there are many more processes involved, but with that, you get an idea of how a knife is forged.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Wow!

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Very impressive.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Our sales in 2020, when the pandemic started from June to December, were 800000 pesos. In 2021, they were 3.5 million. In 2022, 6.5 million.

[Alejandro Litchi - Man]
Did you start making them by hand like you showed us just now? And now you have machinery to produce on a larger scale?

[Speaker 2 - Man]
Yes, production is now solid; we have no problem with production. That's precisely why we came here to get a shark, to ramp it up and take off.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
But they're still forged.

[Speaker 2 - Man]
Yes, exactly.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
The machinery just helps you press faster.

[Speaker 2 - Man]
Faster.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Or the sharpening, they're bigger stones, things like that.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
And is the steel Mexican?

[Speaker 2 - Man]
Yes, everything we use is Mexican, the wood, the steel. We get everything here; we buy the leather for the sheaths here. We try to source everything locally.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
And do you make the leather too?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Yes, we also do the leatherwork; everything is ours.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
You make both things in the same workshop.

[Speaker 2 - Man]
They're separate but very close to each other, so everything is manufactured.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
What impressive work as well.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Now, tell us the average price of each knife.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
The average price is 2200, 2550 pesos, 2700, they vary a bit, but that's the price, more or less 2500 pesos, let's say.

[Alejandro Litchi - Man]
And your cost?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
It's about 45%, so around 1250 pesos is what it costs us.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
How many knives can you produce monthly? What's your capacity?

[Speaker 2 - Man]
1200 knives, that's our limit.

[Alejandro Litchi - Man]
How many would you have to sell to reach 13 million?

[Speaker 2 - Man]
I would say with half the production we have now, we could more or less reach that number. And with the other sectors, the leather and the wood, we'd roughly reach the amount.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
Hey, why didn't you put your brand here? Nowhere.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
It's because those knives are specialties. We launch them on the website as specialties. So we make 15, 20, 30 pieces, launch them, they sell in two days, and then we stop. Then after 15, 20 days, "Coming soon: specialties."

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
That's it.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
And people are there, you always keep them engaged.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
But the others do have your brand?

[Speaker 2 - Man]
All of them have the brand.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
The boar seal and the edge cover that we didn't bring right now, they have the same seal as the roll-up one.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Mine does have it; mine does have the seal.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Mine also has a seal.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Mine does.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Sometimes, if it's very small, we put a little hat or something that identifies us.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Yes, it has a little hat.

[Speaker 2 - Man]
That's the one, the little hat. Yes, that's the one.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
For specialties, we always put different things. But people know it's from Sierra Jabalí.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
And now that you were talking, "coming soon" and so on, do you also sell in the United States?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Yes, we've already started selling in the United States, and it has been very well received.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
Benja, Mauricio, I don't have to think about it much, honestly. I want to tell you, I collect knives and pocket knives, and I love them. And honestly, I really like you guys. And I think that of all the sharks here, I'm the one who knows the most about knives.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
There, humbly.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
Honestly, humbly like you, just the same, with pride and upfront. So I'm going to make you an offer to get this going. I'll offer you the money you're asking for but for 8%. What else do I offer you? First, the enthusiasm of a shark who likes the business and knows it, because I do know. Besides, I've been someone since childhood who always has a knife or a pocket knife on the belt or in the pants or wherever, I always have a knife at hand. That's great. And I think what we can do together is a good campaign. I think I can help you a lot; we can create an online commercial strategy. I can offer you a lot. But first of all, the enthusiasm, and I would commit to this brand to help you grow, and I would enjoy it very much too. So I make you that offer, and I would love to work with you.

[Alejandro Litchi - Man]
Well, since we're making offers, I also have an offer for you. But I'd like to join with Amaury, if you don't mind. Here's how it would be.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
Let's see.

[Alejandro Litchi - Man]
I'd pitch in another 390,000 pesos for another 8%, so we'd each have 8 and 8.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
16.

[Alejandro Litchi - Man]
Uh-huh, 16%. And besides that, I'm not a knife collector, but I'm a lover of grilling. Every weekend, I throw my barbecues. And I can bring to the table one of the largest restaurant chains in Mexico to start with their steakhouses.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Benjamín and Mauricio, I identify a lot with you, me with cakes and you with knives. It seems to me that it's a very good price for what you're delivering. Everything, from the packaging, your brand, how well they're made, honestly, my respects. And that's also something that helps you grow a lot in the market. The only difference we have is that I'm not passionate about knives. But you have very good offers here in the tank, and that's why I'm out.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
Hey, I love your pitch. One of the trends we see on streaming platforms and social networks is this approach of men to grilling and cooking, and I think you're capitalizing wonderfully. I'd love to make you an offer, but I think you have an incredible offer here. So if they let me join with 20% of the investment, I'll join.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
20% of the investment? No, it's very little, Karla, I'm sorry.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
I mean, if you're going to put in 50 and 50, I'll take 10 from him and 10 from you. And I can help you with all the marketing stuff.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
No, it's very little.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
Well, I've never begged any man as much as Amaury, I swear. No one has told me "no" so many times. Well, how can you let me in?

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Hey, well, while they're discussing, I'll tell you. I'm a lover of knives, more in the gastronomic area. Always, and since I was very young, one of the first things I asked my dad to buy me was my knife set. Back then, and still, Japanese knives were like "wow," so I asked for my set of Japanese knives. But I love what you're trying to do with Mexican raw materials, Mexican craftsmanship, and starting to venture into this fine, artisanal knife market for gastronomy. And I think the two sharks at the corner are offering you a somewhat reduced valuation. I offer you the 390,000 pesos you came to ask for but for 6%.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
And will you let me in?

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
No.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
Well, how awful, huh? I'll contribute that I have spectacular knowledge of how to create direct-to-consumer brands, which is what you're doing, and I'll help you understand what attributes people are looking for to lower your acquisition cost.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
So, are you going to pitch in?

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
I'll also go down to 6%, the same offer at 6%.

[Alejandro Litchi - Man]
Come on, we'll match it. We'll come in at 6%, so 12%, but double the money.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
Exactly, mine and Litchi's is double the money, and yours is just you.

[Alejandro Litchi - Man]
And even a vacation, we'll go on vacation, have a barbecue in Puerto Vallarta.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
Now they're playing the vacation card.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Amaury and Litchi, why don't you join me? I'll put in another 390000 for another 6%, and we go 6, 6, and 6, with each putting in 390000 pesos.

[Alejandro Litchi - Man]
Okay.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
Well, whatever they want. I'll join in too.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Me too.

[Alejandro Litchi - Man]
So, look, we'll end up with 5% Amaury, 5% Ale, and 5% me, each of us with 390000 pesos. Do we have a deal?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
We have a deal.
