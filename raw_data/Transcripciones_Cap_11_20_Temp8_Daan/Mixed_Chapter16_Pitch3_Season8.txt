Hello, sharks. We are Beatriz Aguirre and Jesús Guzmán, and together we are Vida Líquida.

[Speaker 2 - Man]
At Vida Líquida, we are fully focused. We have all our passion invested in leaving this world better than we found it. To achieve this, we have developed 13 cleaning and disinfection formulas, which are protected as trade secrets. With these, we can clean anything from a car to an industrial facility using four totally disruptive pillars. The first is that they are biodegradable products, thus protecting the planet. The second is that they are non-toxic for the user. The third is that they are high-performance. And the fourth, and not least important, is that these 13 formulas are registered and protected as trade secrets. They are designed so that they no longer need rinsing, saving between 400 to 1200 liters of water per liter of product used. This is a real way to practice ecology.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Sharks, we are interested in your wisdom, your experience, and also in being able to bring this new way of cleaning to more people for the sake of health and the environment.

[Speaker 2 - Man]
That's right, sharks. For that, we are requesting 280000 pesos for 15% of our company. We invite you to come over; we're going to do a cleaning demonstration. Who wants to join?

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Let's go, Brian.

[Speaker 2 - Man]
Is it dirty?

[Brian Requarth - Man]
Yes, it's quite dirty.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Is that glass cleaner?

[Speaker 2 - Man]
That's right.

[Brian Requarth - Man]
May I?

[Speaker 2 - Man]
Of course, go ahead.

[Brian Requarth - Man]
I'm going to get my hands dirty.

[Speaker 2 - Man]
Yes, well, we didn't apply it there.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
How's it working, Brian?

[Brian Requarth - Man]
Well, it's coming off nicely, as it should.

[Speaker 2 - Man]
Next to you, you have a product we have for hand cleaning. Quickly, I invite you to just remove the seal and pour liquid over it to see what happens to the adhesive. Do you feel the adhesive?

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Yes.

[Speaker 2 - Man]
Now touch it.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Oh! Wow! Magic!

[Speaker 2 - Man]
Thanks, Ale.

[Brian Requarth - Man]
How does it work?

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
It removes the adhesive.

[Brian Requarth - Man]
Really?

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Completely.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Completely, in a second. It's amazing.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
This product is a hand cleaner and disinfectant that you can carry anywhere. The 60-milliliter size was made especially so it can be taken on a plane. The cleaners are also of organic origin. The disinfectant is copper, ionized copper.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
Hey, let me ask you a technical question. How do you stabilize the copper? Are they nanoparticles, or what do you have?

[Speaker 2 - Man]
No, it's ionized.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
It's ionized.

[Speaker 2 - Man]
We ionize it, capture it in water, and then it's easy.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
But it never settles?

[Speaker 2 - Man]
No, not at all.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Copper kills viruses, bacteria, fungi, and algae.

[Speaker 2 - Man]
What production capacity do you have?

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
And where do you produce?

[Speaker 2 - Man]
We have our headquarters in Puebla. That's where our production center is. Currently, we can produce about 3000 to 4000 liters per month.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
The way we're doing it currently.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
If you sold everything, how much would that represent in sales?

[Speaker 2 - Man]
If we sold everything, it would be 400, almost 500 thousand pesos per month.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
Hey, Beatriz, Jesús, what's up with the plastic containers?

[Speaker 2 - Man]
Precisely, all our containers have this sticker where we refund 50 cents to the customer because we don't reuse but recycle. We recover the PET plastic, we destroy it, since they are organic, they get contaminated very easily, so we destroy it and donate it to people who recycle PET.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
I'm concerned, Jesús, because relying on the customer to recycle is not properly recycling.

[Speaker 2 - Man]
Okay.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
I mean, well, it's not recycling. Let's say you are not doing it; you're depending on the customer for that to happen. So just be careful because your logo says "eco-friendly cleaning."

[Speaker 2 - Man]
That's right.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
And I don't doubt that the product is biodegradable or breaks down naturally, but your containers seem to me like the ones we most often see in the trash. And from what I understand, they are not made with recycled PET.

[Brian Requarth - Man]
I'll tell you where I stand. In fact, it reminds me of my childhood, and you might be wondering why. The reality is that my mom, who is an awesome feminist, had me doing chores as a kid. She didn't want me to be a spoiled child, so she taught me those important lessons. I'm not the shark for you in this case. You have an interesting business, but it's not the business for me. So, for that reason, I'm out.

[Speaker 2 - Man]
Thank you.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
I have a mantra that I always repeat: product first, then brand. You have a good product, as you demonstrated to us, and that's wonderful. With that, you can start off very well. But if your brand and your whole image are lacking a lot, I think the big challenge you have is that those 280,000 pesos won't be enough for all the challenges you've mentioned, like marketing and everything you want to invest in new packaging. For now, because of all these challenges ahead and the amount of money that I don't think would be enough to address them, I'm out.

[Speaker 2 - Man]
Thank you, Marisa.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
What I loved is that you care about people's health. I think they're good products from what we've seen here. But it's not always enough to have a good product and that's it. I mean, just having a good product doesn't always mean you're going to sell. So I think you already have the formulas, you have the product, that's very good, and I congratulate you. But now you need to focus heavily on improving the packaging and especially the product image. For now, I'm out.

[Speaker 2 - Man]
Thank you, Ale. In fact, 30% of what we're asking for is for branding, to completely improve the image.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
I understand that changing to eco-friendly packaging is a gigantic challenge, that they ask you for a minimum quantity. I think we're all aware that the world is still in this transition and that we'd all like to improve where we can. But just by seeing your large industrial-size bottle with a label that doesn't necessarily have to be that big and made of giant plastic tells me that I don't necessarily feel you're being consistent. I'd prefer if you said, "Hey, we need help to really make our product ecological." Therefore, you didn't capture my interest, and I'm out.

[Speaker 2 - Man]
Thank you, Amaury. Much success.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
I believe a lot in copper as a cleaner. I love that you're taking care of people's hands. I think there's a market; of course, the packaging needs improvement, the label needs improvement. But these are things that I think are difficult to demand from such a young company right from the start. I will make you an offer. I will offer you what you came to ask for, but for 20%. What do you say? Do we have a deal?

[Speaker 2 - Man]
Of course we do, Marcus.
