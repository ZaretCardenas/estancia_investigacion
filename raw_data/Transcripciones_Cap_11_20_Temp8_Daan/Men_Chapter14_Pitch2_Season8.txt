It is a true privilege to be with you today. I am Dr. César Sánchez Galeana, an ophthalmologist surgeon with 25 years of experience in ophthalmic surgery. For 25 years, I have been taking photographs of my patients, and they are amazed by the incredible details hidden within the iris of their eyes. It took me several months to develop a system to photograph and use the ophthalmological equipment we doctors use, combined with the most advanced photographic systems. This is how I developed Croma Iris. The average cost of a piece of art like the ones you're seeing or a piece of jewelry is between 1200 and 700 pesos. You might recall that a few days ago, someone took your photograph, that was me incognito. I brought my equipment to you, and I appreciate your kindness. This is the result of the iris photography. The sunflower is your iris, Ale. In your case, Lichi, it's the one at the back with some stones and diamonds. Marcus, I had the fortune of meeting your wife, and we made a combination of her iris and yours, uniting them in an infinity symbol. Oso, yours is the one with a black background. And Amaury, yours is the one at the back, entering the net like a fabulous goal. Today, I'm here to ask for 250000 pesos for 20% of Croma Iris. What I've practically done is my field test, and I want to take it to a shopping mall or a place with lots of people and heavy foot traffic, so it can gain traction.

[Alejandro Litchi - Male]
To set up a branch like this, what do you need? How much does the necessary equipment cost?

[Speaker 1 - Male]
Setting up a kiosk in a shopping mall with the cabinet costs around 250000 to 300000 pesos. This system is already fully developed. You train the operator, and they can use it. You can set up 20, 30, or 50, its growth is only limited by your imagination.

[Oso Trava - Male]
César, is this patentable? How do you protect yourself? Because it's quite a simple system, a camera, a couple of lights, and someone with Photoshop. How do you defend your brand?

[Speaker 1 - Male]
We're in the process of obtaining an industrial utility model. That is, using it with the ophthalmological system and the way we have it configured, we're going to have it registered.

[Alejandro Litchi - Male]
I once saw this in Europe, and a piece like this costs around 100 euros. You're slightly below that, roughly.

[Speaker 1 - Male]
Yes. For example, these are 60 centimeters and are priced at around 3,200 pesos, yielding a gross profit of approximately 1,800 pesos.

[Alejandra Ríos - Female]
I feel like you haven't done a complete market test. Have you had a pilot program?

[Speaker 1 - Male]
Yes. We had a test run on social media. We had the opportunity to participate in national TV and radio shows. Based on the European experience, I don't see why the Mexican market would be very different.

[Alejandra Ríos - Female]
Doctor, honestly, I don't like the product. It doesn't appeal to me, and that's why I'm out.

[Speaker 1 - Male]
Thank you very much.

[Marcus Dantus - Male]
Two very quick questions. Do you have a registered trademark?

[Speaker 1 - Male]
Yes, it is trademarked.

[Marcus Dantus - Male]
Do you have a registered company?

[Speaker 1 - Male]
Currently, the company operates under my medical practice as a tool, but it can be restructured as a separate company.

[Oso Trava - Male]
Who is going to manage this new company? Because this is a new venture that has nothing to do with running a medical practice.

[Speaker 1 - Male]
I'm at a point in my life where I can allocate my time as needed. I can dedicate 80%, even 100% of my time to grow this.

[Amaury Vergara - Male]
Doc, to me, this is a novelty business. It could have a good boom and be successful, but it could also go out of fashion. It's not the type of business I'm passionate about. For those reasons, I'm out. I wish you much success.

[Speaker 1 - Male]
Thank you very much, Amaury.

[Alejandro Litchi - Male]
I see several very interesting points here. I think it's something new for Mexico. I believe no one else is doing it as you describe. It has the potential to grow. Right now, it's very early. Since you haven't done a proper market test yet in a shopping mall setting, it's not proven. So for now, I'm out.

[Speaker 1 - Male]
I greatly appreciate it, Alejandro. Thank you very much.

[Oso Trava - Male]
I have experience opening stores in shopping malls, setting up kiosks. It takes time, and choosing the wrong location can even be the end of a business. I do think there are more agile ways to conduct tests, so to speak. I see many risks and share Amaury's concern. Anyone, even if they don't do it perfectly, could set up a small camera and a kiosk or stand, take photos that might be slightly inferior, but they'll be eating into the market and making noise. For as attractive as the product might be to those who like it, I feel the brand needs a lot of work, and that makes me doubt even more. That said, I like it. I do believe it's a good way to create something very personalized for a family.

[Speaker 1 - Male]
Yes.

[Speaker 1 - Male]
So I'm going to make you an offer.

[Alejandra Ríos - Female]
There you go.

[Oso Trava - Male]
I'm going to offer you the 250000 pesos but for 30% of the company.

[Speaker 1 - Male]
Thank you for your offer, Oso. I sincerely appreciate it. Marcus?

[Marcus Dantus - Male]
It's just that I do like it.

[Oso Trava - Male]
Jump in.

[Marcus Dantus - Male]
I mean, I see all the risks; it's unproven, but I see how we could make money with something like this. We need to test it, and I'd like to help you develop the company. So, I don't know, do you want us to join in on the offer? I'll go in with you if you like. I'll partner with Oso, covering half of the offer. In fact, Oso, if you're agreeable, so you don't feel we're taking a big chunk of the company, I'd be willing to return a small portion to you once we recover the 250000 pesos. Or we can lower our stake to 25%. We can reduce it to 25%.

[Speaker 1 - Male]
May I think for a moment?

[Marcus Dantus - Male]
Of course.

[Alejandra Ríos - Female]
Absolutely.

[Speaker 1 - Male]
I accept your offer. We have a deal.
