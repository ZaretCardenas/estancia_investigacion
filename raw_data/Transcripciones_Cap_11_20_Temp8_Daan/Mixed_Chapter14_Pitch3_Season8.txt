Hello, sharks. I'm Mariana.

[Speaker 1 - Male]
I'm Alec, and we are both founders of Nuvo Foods, a vegan brand. Our mission is to make plant-based food accessible and easy for all kinds of people. That's why we have taken on the task of creating a line of products to make meat alternatives that have the quality, taste, and texture of any animal protein on the market.

[Speaker 2 - Female]
With our shredded chicken, beef, and pork, you can prepare any recipe you want, from nuggets and enchiladas to flautas. These products do not require a cold chain and have a shelf life of 12 to 24 months.

[Speaker 1 - Male]
Since 2019, when we started focusing 100% on this project, we went from selling one million pesos to, in the last year, which was 2022, 2.3 million pesos with just our line of vegan cookies. The year 2020 made us reflect on the impact and reach we wanted with this venture. That's why we started working from the end of 2021 to develop this new line of products and this new stage of the company. That's why we want to invite you to be part of it, and we are requesting an investment of 2 million pesos for 13% of our total company. This would be part of an open capital raise that already has the support of one of the most important international investment funds in this category.

[Speaker 2 - Female]
Oso, we invite you to help us prepare one of our plant mixes.

[Oso Trava - Male]
Let's go.

[Speaker 1 - Male]
I'll help you so you don't get dirty.

[Oso Trava - Male]
What is this made of?

[Speaker 2 - Female]
Look, they are made from plant-based proteins, pea protein and wheat protein.

[Amaury Vergara - Male]
With the apron, I believe you really cook, huh, Oso?

[Oso Trava - Male]
Right?

[Amaury Vergara - Male]
Yes.

[Speaker 2 - Female]
We place the container.

[Oso Trava - Male]
Do I pour everything in?

[Speaker 2 - Female]
Yes, pour everything in.

[Oso Trava - Male]
It's like powder.

[Speaker 2 - Female]
Uh-huh.

[Oso Trava - Male]
We put it here.

[Speaker 2 - Female]
You have to keep stirring.

[Amaury Vergara - Male]
Alec, a question. Are you inviting us to this brand, Ser Vegano, or to Nuvo Foods?

[Speaker 1 - Male]
It's the entire company.

[Oso Trava - Male]
Alec, I have a question. You sold 2.3 million pesos in cookies last year. You haven't sold anything from this new line.

[Speaker 1 - Male]
Yes, we've sold approximately 60000 pesos in 3 months without any advertising, only through marketplaces and with some partnerships we have with three restaurants, two of them are omnivorous, with whom we've created burgers, meatballs, and in one, we have a vegan lasagna.

[Oso Trava - Male]
How many SKUs does the new line have?

[Speaker 1 - Male]
Currently, there are eight.

[Oso Trava - Male]
Smells delicious.

[Speaker 2 - Female]
Yes, it really does. Do we add ingredients?

[Speaker 1 - Male]
We'll now let you taste it so you can see the versatility of the products.

[Alejandra Ríos - Female]
Did they turn out good, Oso?

[Alejandro Litchi - Male]
The chef.

[Oso Trava - Male]
You'll see.

[Amaury Vergara - Male]
Thank you very much.

[Alejandro Litchi - Male]
Thanks, maestro.

[Alejandra Ríos - Female]
I'm a bit lost, Alejandro. So you started in 2019 with a line of cookies.

[Speaker 1 - Male]
Yes.

[Alejandra Ríos - Female]
And then, in 2021, you started with this line of animal protein alternatives.

[Speaker 1 - Male]
Exactly.

[Alejandra Ríos - Female]
And in this line, you have eight SKUs.

[Speaker 2 - Female]
I put a little chicken for you, Ale, so you can try it.

[Alejandra Ríos - Female]
Thank you.

[Speaker 1 - Male]
So you can see all the versatility.

[Speaker 2 - Female]
What did you think?

[Oso Trava - Male]
I liked it a lot.

[Marcus Dantus - Male]
I think the "cochinita" has a good consistency. It's tasty.

[Speaker 1 - Male]
Thank you.

[Marcus Dantus - Male]
Alec, sorry to insist. There's a part I still don't understand. You already have a fund interested in investing.

[Speaker 1 - Male]
Exactly. This investment fund invests at least 180,000 euros more, and we are in talks with two other funds, one from Ireland and another from Paris, France.

[Alejandro Litchi - Male]
With the one you already have signed, what percentage are you giving them?

[Speaker 1 - Male]
They are guaranteed 4% of the company with a valuation of one and a half million euros.

[Alejandro Litchi - Male]
Here, you valued the company at 15 million pesos, so why is it valued at 30 million pesos with the fund?

[Speaker 1 - Male]
Since it's an open capital raise, we know their money is worth more.

[Alejandro Litchi - Male]
I think you're tackling a very cool problem. I think the idea you have is very good. I didn't like the image at all, honestly. I'm a person for whom it would be impossible to become vegan, but I think there's increasing awareness, and more people are betting on this. Since it's not for me, and I don't think I can support you much, I'm out, but I wish you much success.

[Speaker 1 - Male]
Thank you very much.

[Marcus Dantus - Male]
I have a problem with the valuation. The reality is that I'm very surprised when entrepreneurs who already have the interest of a fund at an even higher valuation are willing to sacrifice their valuation, and that makes me a bit distrustful. And I think it's a trust issue, and that's why I'm out.

[Speaker 1 - Male]
Okay. Thanks, Marcus.

[Amaury Vergara - Male]
Alec, Mariana, something similar happens to me. It seems that this fund investing in you is still not sure. Another thing, I wasn't crazy about the protein recipes. And for those reasons, I'm out.

[Speaker 2 - Female]
Thank you.

[Oso Trava - Male]
I understand that having tools like this is great, and I really liked it. I was struck by the fact that it doesn't require a cold chain, that it's very tasty. But talking so much about accelerators, funds, capital, it makes me very nervous. I'd love to be able to help you, but I think it's not the right moment for me, and that's why I'm out.

[Speaker 2 - Female]
Thank you.

[Alejandra Ríos - Female]
Mariana and Alejandro, you've already heard many comments; I won't repeat them. I didn't like the product, and I didn't click with you as entrepreneurs. Something is missing, and that's why I'm out.
