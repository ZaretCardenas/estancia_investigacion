Hello, sharks. Before we begin, allow me to get rid of this. That's how an entrepreneur feels when using Legitt. You, better than anyone, know that starting a business is difficult. In fact, out of every ten startups, only one survives. We are Isaac and Sofia, and together we want to eradicate the number of startups that fail due to legal problems through Legitt, the first legal store focused on entrepreneurs, SMEs, and startups. At Legitt, we want to solve three big problems with three solutions that represent our three sources of income.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
The first problem entrepreneurs face is this: an extremely complex legal ecosystem, full of procedures, bureaucracy, and lengthy contracts that no one understands, filled with concepts that few use. The solution: a legal store with ready-to-use products. The second problem is that finding a good lawyer is a very complicated task. The solution: a search engine for lawyers specialized in entrepreneurship. The third problem: legal services are very costly. We want to reduce those costs by providing lawyers with a platform that gives them access to the legal technology they need and even the possibility to collaborate with other lawyers.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
As of today, our flagship product in the store is a monthly subscription that entrepreneurs can purchase to meet their daily legal needs. In 2021, we had revenues of 450000 pesos. For 2022, revenues of one million pesos. And just in the first two months of 2023, we've already had revenues of 350000 pesos.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Sharks, what do we want? We are asking for 500000 pesos in exchange for 10% of Legitt.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
Hey, you talk about a monthly subscription. I want to know how much the monthly subscription costs for startups and what it includes.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
We have three levels: Basic, Standard, and Pro. They range from 10000, 15000, and 25000 pesos, and they include packages of hours and monthly follow-ups, depending on the package.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
How many subscribers do you currently have?

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
We have 70 lawyers.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
No, client subscribers.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
20.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
20.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
These 20 subscribers are, I imagine, recurring.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Correct.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
Meaning they've been with you for over a year. What is recurring for you?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
We haven't lost any of the 22 clients who started their subscription with us.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
Okay.

[Brian Requarth - Man]
I have a conflict. I have a conflict of interest here, in terms of something I'm working on. So I might be out because of that.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Thank you very much.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
Now let me ask another financial question. You have 20 clients who are paying you at least 10000 pesos a month. So you're earning at least 200000 pesos monthly. Why did you have only one million in sales last year?

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Yes, uh...

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
I mean, something doesn't add up with the numbers. Why did you have one million in sales last year?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Actually, those clients are recurring clients who have scaled through different plans. As you said, they are paying at least 10000 pesos.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Your sales don't make sense with the numbers you gave us. And it also makes us think that you haven't sold anything besides those 20 subscriptions. None of the additional products, nor commissions from lawyers, nothing.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
And all are basic plans.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
No, it's a fact that the concrete number, as we're presenting it, doesn't add up. And it's also a fact that we haven't lost any clients. But it's also a fact that many of the startups we've advised haven't stopped hiring us, but they've failed along the way. So we've actually lost clients, not due to a failure in our product, but because of them.

[Brian Requarth - Man]
Well, that's something to consider, right? Because if you're analyzing the market and your clients don't survive, maybe you're in the wrong market or you're targeting a market that attracts unqualified clients, right?

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
I don't quite agree because if they have entrepreneurs whom they are helping with the legal part, they don't have control over these people's ventures.

[Brian Requarth - Man]
Obviously, but they're selling poorly to clients who are not qualified.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
No, no, they may be qualified, but along the entrepreneurial journey, there's a high rate of failure. You can have the best qualifications, the best idea, and many fail along the way. It's not easy to be an entrepreneur.

[Brian Requarth - Man]
I know, I know.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
It's not up to them whether the entrepreneur does well.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
That's the problem.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
No, but they...

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
That's the problem because if it doesn't depend on them to keep their clients...

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
It's not a company that helps entrepreneurs to launch.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Exactly, but if they're selling to a group of people who may disappear over time, then it's a business model with a lot of risk.

[Brian Requarth - Man]
You have to qualify your clients. We think about lifetime value businesses, what we call the value of the client's life, and if you're selling to a high-risk audience because they fail, that's a bad business.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
I don't agree at all; it has nothing to do with it.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Neither do I. Why? Because it has nothing to do with it.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
The only thing you're saying that I agree with is that to calculate their value, their lifetime value, it's probably not 12 or 24 months. Maybe it's fewer months on average, but you have nothing to do with the qualified client.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Nothing.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
It's a client who needs legal services, period.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Exactly, exactly.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
But what I'm saying is that it's a business that attracts high-risk clients, period.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Because that's how all entrepreneurs are.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Yes, yes, yes, that's why.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Ah, but you can't select them.

[Brian Requarth - Man]
I understand what you're saying, but at the same time, it's not working; they're not staying; they're going bankrupt. Out of 20 clients, how many have failed? Well, we can do the math.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
How many have failed?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Exactly right. That's how we started our pitch. One out of every ten startups survives the first two years.

[Brian Requarth - Man]
Yeah.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
We are trying to solve and reduce that friction so it's easier to undertake and so that failing isn't due to a legal problem.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Or they can look for solutions that continue to attract, because I think your solution is very good, and your idea is very good for entrepreneurs.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
But I don't understand what the discussion is. You started by saying that you're for startups and SMEs. That was the idea you brought, right?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Yes, correct.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
There are already companies doing this here in Mexico that are also using artificial intelligence to generate these products they call. That's why I'm out.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Thank you very much.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
Isaac, Sofia. I feel that you're aiming at too many things, subscriptions, basic, pro. I think you should focus on a single product that serves as a hook for those SMEs, for those entrepreneurs, and then from there, somehow, you'll know how to evolve it into something more recurring. But since the numbers don't make sense to me, and I don't feel I can contribute more than what I've just said, I'm out. I wish you much success.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Thank you very much.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
I think what you're doing is interesting; it's an existing market. SMEs need lawyers; startups need lawyers. They need... I mean, you're calling it a subscription model to sound more like an internet model, but essentially, it's a monthly retainer with a number of paid hours. The problem you have is that the retainer/subscription is very high. Very few SMEs and very few startups will be able to pay you that amount of money. And that's why I'm out.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Thank you very much.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Isaac and Sofia, I think your venture is a very good idea. I believe what you lack right now is to have a strong critical mass so you can really reach much more attractive numbers. I'm out, but I also think something important you need to learn and continue to work on is that you are entrepreneurs too. And overcoming these kinds of difficulties, being rejected, not having people believe in your idea, is a fundamental part of what an entrepreneur has to tolerate. So today, it's your turn to face this. I'm sure you'll come out stronger.
