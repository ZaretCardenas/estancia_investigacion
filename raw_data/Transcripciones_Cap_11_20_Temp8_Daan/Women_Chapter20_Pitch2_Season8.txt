Hello, sharks. I'm Sandra and I represent Metacao. Metacao is 100% cacao. It's toasted and ground. It contains no fat, no sugar, and no dairy. Metacao provides great, great emotional, nutritional, and physical benefits. It gives you an energy boost, regulates your blood system, and regulates your blood pressure. It works as a natural antidepressant, and most importantly, it is a conductor of serotonin and endorphins. And this gives us pleasure and happiness. Metacao had its recent launch in November 2022, that is, just four months ago. But today we are already in the most important retail stores in the country. We have our own marketplace. We are in the most important marketplace in the world, and we already have a presence in some restaurants and cafes. On your table, you have a French press; I invite you to press it down, pour it into your cup, and taste it.

[Amaury Vergara - Male]
It's tasty.

[Marisa Lazo - Female]
Delicious.

[Alejandra Ríos - Female]
Mmm, delicious.

[Speaker 1 - Female]
Today we are asking for only 500000 pesos for 10% of our company.

[Alejandro Litchi - Male]
Sandra, tell me about the competition because I've seen something similar before. In fact, I've bought it, and it's a bit cheaper.

[Speaker 1 - Female]
The cacao we find on the market today is washed cacao that is just ground. Our cacao is fermented, toasted, ground, and also has an innovative process where it is pressed. The cacao seed has 40 percent fat. What we did in this process over many months with food engineers, chocolatiers, and doctors was to arrive at this product by removing almost 96 percent of the fat.

[Alejandro Litchi - Male]
Wow. It's very tasty, huh?

[Alejandra Ríos - Female]
Yes, it's very tasty.

[Speaker 1 - Female]
Thank you very much.

[Amaury Vergara - Male]
So it has no difference; it's just the process that gives it this flavor.

[Speaker 1 - Female]
That's correct. It's 100 percent cacao.

[Amaury Vergara - Male]
How delicious.

[Alejandra Ríos - Female]
Let's talk numbers, Sandra.

[Speaker 1 - Female]
Yes.

[Alejandra Ríos - Female]
How much do you expect to sell this year, in 2023?

[Speaker 1 - Female]
The forecast is to sell, we are going to sell one million pesos, with a profit margin of 56 percent.

[Alejandra Ríos - Female]
Okay, so why are you valuing your company at five times this year's projected sales?

[Speaker 1 - Female]
Because we believe that with the investment we are going to obtain, we will be able to have much more presence, we will be able to do much more branding, we will be able to have working capital, which is what my partner and I lack.

[Amaury Vergara - Male]
Sandra, what do you expect from your shark partner, male or female?

[Speaker 1 - Female]
Look, the truth is that my partner and I have talked about it a lot. What we expect is this support. We expect these contacts, negotiations, advice, because that's the most important thing for us right now. How do we make this reach the world?

[Alejandra Ríos - Female]
Sandra, and tell us about your partner. What part of the business does she handle, and what percentage of shares does each of you have?

[Speaker 1 - Female]
She is a much more organized person than I am, and that's wonderful for me because I throw out ideas and proposals, and then we have to get quotes here, do this there, look for this, and she keeps up with me on all these things and helps me a lot with the implementation in the business. She currently has 20% of the company's shares, and I have 80%.

[Alejandra Ríos - Female]
Every answer you give, Sandra, makes me like you more.

[Speaker 1 - Female]
Oh, that's great!

[Karla Berman - Female]
Sandra, I love you as an entrepreneur; I love your passion and your resilience. It seems like you're creating a new category. I'm fascinated, but I don't know anything about this business. Therefore, with a bit of regret, I'm out.

[Marisa Lazo - Female]
Sandra, your brand is very beautiful. In Mexico, notice that 41% of women feel they are capable of starting a business, but today only about 14 or 15% dare to do so, and you are a great example of an entrepreneurial woman.

[Speaker 1 - Female]
Thank you.

[Marisa Lazo - Female]
It's a great project; it's a great product, but the valuation is higher than I expected, and for that reason, I'm out.

[Speaker 1 - Female]
Okay, thank you very much, Marisa.

[Amaury Vergara - Male]
Sandra, I'm thinking a lot. I would get involved, this is to support you. Maybe in the future, I could become a partner. I'm willing to make you an offer.

[Speaker 1 - Female]
Okay.

[Amaury Vergara - Male]
But I think I can make it as a loan. I'll lend you that 500000 for 10%, and once I recover the loan, I'll return the 10% to you.

[Speaker 1 - Female]
Thank you very much, Amaury. Thank you very much.

[Alejandra Ríos - Female]
Sandra, the product is great. You've just started, you've been with this product for four months. We still don't really know how your sales will go, and you came with a very high valuation, five times projected sales. So, for an investor, it's a high risk.

[Speaker 1 - Female]
Yes.

[Alejandra Ríos - Female]
And with all the regret in the world, that's why I'm out.

[Speaker 1 - Female]
Of course. Thank you very much, Ale.

[Alejandro Litchi - Male]
I disagree a lot with what they're saying about you coming in too early, and well, it's never too early to be an entrepreneur. So I congratulate you for starting and for doing it so well. Your valuation is extremely high, but I will make you an offer. I'll offer you the 500000 pesos you're asking for but for 20%.

[Amaury Vergara - Male]
Okay, Sandra, so with Litchi's offer, I'm going to modify my offer a bit. As an investor, I'm out, so I'll lend you the 500000; we'll agree on the rate later, and that way everyone's happy, we help you grow, and you have a shark investor partner.

[Speaker 1 - Female]
Thank you very much, Amaury. I think that at this moment, what we need is exactly this, to join forces. And I think that at this moment, if you agree, I accept the loan and the investment.

[Alejandro Litchi - Male]
So, Sandra, do we have a deal?

[Speaker 1 - Female]
Great, we have a deal.
