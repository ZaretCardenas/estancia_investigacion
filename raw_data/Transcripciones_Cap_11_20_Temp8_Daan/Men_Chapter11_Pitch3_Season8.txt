[Speaker 1 - Male]
Hello sharks, I'm Homero, CEO and founder of Cuvo, a construction ecosystem. In 2011, I opened my small construction company as a good entrepreneur, but I realized that the problem of entrepreneurs was totally different from the problem of professionals. Now, the lack of clients, suppliers, talent, and worst of all, not having contacts. The solution: Cuvo, a comprehensive construction ecosystem that makes real-time, direct connections possible among the key players in the industry. For professionals, we are a startup for placement and professional growth. In the construction industry, time is money. When companies used to take weeks or months to find a specific profile, with Cuvo they can find it in seconds. We offer suppliers the creation of virtual offices so they can explore the market in different parts of our country and the world. Our mission is that every infrastructure project carries our seal. And our vision is that when you think of construction, you think of Cuvo. And that's why we're here, because we need your help to reach the next level with an investment of 500000 pesos for 5% equity and a 500000-peso loan. So, who's ready to create connections with Cuvo?

[Karla Berman - Female]
Homero, if I understand correctly, you're creating a marketplace where you address market inefficiencies because there are so many suppliers, so many workers, and many people looking for them for their projects. And there are inefficiencies because they don't know where to find each other. How many suppliers and how many workers and professionals in the industry do you already have listed on your platform?

[Speaker 1 - Male]
Currently, we have over 2300 users on the platform.

[Karla Berman - Female]
Who are these users? Those who hire or those who offer their services?

[Speaker 1 - Male]
Of those 2300, 90% are professionals.

[Karla Berman - Female]
Who offer their services?

[Speaker 1 - Male]
Exactly. 5% are construction companies, and the remaining 5% are supplier companies.

[Karla Berman - Female]
How are these products sold? Do you charge a percentage? Where do these 120000 pesos come from?

[Speaker 1 - Male]
We help construction companies save money and supplier companies generate sales. So, having identified this market, we charge annual memberships: 24000 pesos per year to construction companies and 24000 pesos per year to supplier companies. In four weeks, we managed to generate these sales of five memberships for this year.

[Marisa Lazo - Female]
You didn't give us your sales numbers. Tell us a bit per year, if you can, at least the last three years.

[Speaker 1 - Male]
In September 2022, we launched our pilot. With this pilot, what we gained was traction. Our series of memberships started, and to date, we have sold 120000 pesos.

[Alejandra Ríos - Female]
You just mentioned you've made five transactions, five connections. What else do you plan to do to generate value for the suppliers and constructors, who are the ones you're actually charging and where you're generating income?

[Speaker 1 - Male]
A construction company, when looking for professionals, also invests money. They approximately invest 5000 pesos per month and for the duration of the hiring in a not-so-specific profile. They used to take three months to do it, and with Cuvo, they take eight seconds to find it. So, you also generate that value for the construction company. Additionally, we are developing a tool with all the data we gather. We will have up-to-date numbers on material costs.

[Marcus Dantus - Male]
Homero, let me understand your numbers. Do you charge all the suppliers and all the constructors?

[Speaker 1 - Male]
No. Registrations are free. What we charge is unlocking the connection tools for suppliers and construction companies that desire it.

[Marcus Dantus - Male]
But if I register, what do I have access to for free?

[Speaker 1 - Male]
To the preview of everything in our ecosystem. What I don't give you are direct contacts. I don't give you the chat because we created a chat with a basic CRM within a sales chat, but you don't have that either.

[Marcus Dantus - Male]
So, let me ask you more directly. How many have converted to paying customers?

[Speaker 1 - Male]
Two, but without us seeking them out.

[Karla Berman - Female]
And why haven't you sought them out?

[Alejandra Ríos - Female]
Sorry to interrupt, Karla. You have sales of 120000 pesos starting from February when you launched in the market and converted five people. And you're valuing your company at 10 million pesos. Please explain.

[Speaker 1 - Male]
The value of startups at this stage had an X range. And what I did was lower that X range to generate interest. But there's really no specific reason for the valuation.

[Marcus Dantus - Male]
But Ale's question is very valid. Do you think your company is worth 10 million pesos right now?

[Speaker 1 - Male]
I believe my company is worth more than 10 million pesos right now.

[Alejandra Ríos - Female]
Homero, I think you need to find a way to monetize it, to do business. I think you came at a very early stage to present your venture. You have a long way to go, study this type of business well, and that's why I'm out.

[Speaker 1 - Male]
Thank you, Ale.

[Amaury Vergara - Male]
But I think you did well to come to the tank. I think there's nothing wrong with being an entrepreneur, having that drive, that attitude, and saying, "I'm going to the tank, and I'm going for an investment." You're going to leave with valuable insights, like "I need to refine this, perfect that, I'm missing this." Focus very well on one thing, and then you can create a platform that offers many things. That's my suggestion for you. For those reasons, and I want you to do very well, but I'm not the shark for you, I'm out.

[Marisa Lazo - Female]
Because of all the ground you still have to cover and how undeveloped your business still is, as we all said, I'm out. But I think you had a great opportunity to be in front of all of us, and I think you're taking away very good ideas that you can apply and give a twist to this idea that sounds quite good.

[Speaker 1 - Male]
Thank you.

[Karla Berman - Female]
I'm not scared by the valuation. What worries me is that I think you're not focusing on the main market asymmetry because there aren't really that many construction material suppliers.

[Speaker 1 - Male]
Let's remember that we are not an intermediary. In fact, that's why Cuvo was born, to eliminate intermediaries. We offer them the data they need to connect directly with others.

[Marcus Dantus - Male]
Do you charge a commission if you sell something?

[Speaker 1 - Male]
No.

[Marcus Dantus - Male]
Nothing? Never?

[Speaker 1 - Male]
No.

[Karla Berman - Female]
Homero, I think it's a mistake. I believe the business model shouldn't be based on an annual membership. It should involve taking a take rate, which is a percentage of the transactions generated on your platform. If you want to become the marketplace of the construction industry and be the traffic hub where people pass through, not just suppliers now, but eventually legal firms and trades, I think you have to charge per transaction. Additionally, paying 24000 pesos upfront, I don't know how much traction you'll get.

[Speaker 1 - Male]
It seems like an exaggerated number, but in the construction industry, it practically becomes a quite attractive investment.

[Marcus Dantus - Male]
Look, I'd give you two pieces of advice. First, if you really want to create a multiplatform, I think you're going to have to start free and then generate a lot of users, and that will give you traction. Second, for the stage you're in, it's not an investment for me, so I'm out.

[Karla Berman - Female]
Well, look, I think there's a market and an entrepreneur; the valuation doesn't scare me. But most startups die not of hunger but of indigestion. I think you're trying to do too many things at the same time. I don't like the business model, and I invite you to rethink it. I'd love to advise you if you decide to make that pivot. But for now, I'm out.
