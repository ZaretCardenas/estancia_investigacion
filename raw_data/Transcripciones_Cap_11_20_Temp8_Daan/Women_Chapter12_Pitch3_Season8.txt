[Speaker 1 - Female]
Hello, sharks. I'm Sofía Morgenroth, and my great talent is creating methodologies and products that transform and impact spaces. Has it ever happened to you that... Ah, right? This is what nearly 7 million people with disabilities in Mexico experience every day. Because of this, today we come to show you Idélu, a company through which, using inclusive games and various services, we have managed to transform lives and spaces. After helping an elderly woman with visual impairment, I offered to teach her Braille, assuming there was already a product that would allow her to learn Braille autonomously, without depending on anyone, but there wasn't. Therefore, I took on the task of developing a methodology and a functional, friendly, and inclusive product for her. Seeing its impact and functionality, I decided to start the venture.

Idélu is the first company to create inclusive board games that are not infantilized, suitable for people with and without disabilities of various ages. So far, I have developed a total of five inclusive board games with intellectual property and unique methodologies. Spruch is the first board game I have launched on the market. It's a card game, unique worldwide. So far, we have been selling on various e-commerce platforms and at mass events. I want to invite all five of you to play Spruch. Don't be scared. Okay. No one touch the cards. You have to create triplets. You need to find the letter 'i' in the other two modalities; for example, you will see the letter 'M'. Okay? So you have to flip over a blue one and a dark one, whichever you like, until you find the letter 'i' in the three modalities. And what do you have to do when you find the third one? Make the sign. Very good, you were ahead. But you're still missing another one.

[Marisa Lazo - Female]
In dark, right?

[Speaker 1 - Female]
Yes. Okay, then no, it gets turned over. And we continue with Ale.

[Alejandra Ríos - Female]
Excellent.

[Amaury Vergara - Male]
It's like a memory game.

[Speaker 1 - Female]
Yes, it's like a memory game, exactly. The third one is missing, the blue one is missing.

[Amaury Vergara - Male]
One more is missing.

[Speaker 1 - Female]
No, let's go back to basics, let's go back to basics.

[Alejandra Ríos - Female]
No, it's your turn. Brian's up. Come on, you're missing one, you're missing one. Of this color.

[Brian Requarth - Male]
What was it?

[Speaker 1 - Female]
Good, now you have to make the sign. So, well, in this case, our dear shark has won, and you can go sit down.

[Alejandra Ríos - Female]
Okay, but we understand now.

[Speaker 1 - Female]
And as we know that more lives need to be impacted by Idélu, that's why today we want to invite you to join inclusion. For this, we are offering 20% of Idélu in exchange for 300000 pesos. What are we going to use this money for? To protect the intellectual property of Spruch and the new product to take it to Spain, the United States, and also within Mexico. And additionally, to digitize my consulting services.

[Marisa Lazo - Female]
Tell us, Sofía, a bit more about your sales.

[Speaker 1 - Female]
Well, let's say we are new, so I have sold around 100000 pesos. I organically sell an average of 30 games per month. The retail price of Spruch is 359 pesos. The current cost of producing Spruch is 100 pesos per unit. There are signs that have movements, so I decided to add a QR code to the instructions that gives access to a private video on YouTube.

[Amaury Vergara - Male]
Sofía. Hello. How many countries do you want to expand to next year, for example?

[Speaker 1 - Female]
Spain and the United States.

[Amaury Vergara - Male]
How do you sell the product? What is your sales channel?

[Speaker 1 - Female]
Through large e-commerce platforms.

[Brian Requarth - Male]
It's good to have a very broad vision of the world and to have great ambition. What I would do, if I were you, is show more that there is demand and focus on a specific market first before thinking globally.

[Speaker 1 - Female]
But there is. My main market is not people with disabilities.

[Brian Requarth - Male]
I understand that part and think it's important, but my point remains the same. Why think outside of Mexico when you need to show there's interest in Mexico first?

[Speaker 1 - Female]
Yes, I have an answer for that. I was at a massive event and met someone from Spain. He loved the product. He told me, "We need this over there," etc. He said, "As soon as you protect it, write to me." So, the demand exists.

[Marcus Dantus - Male]
Let me reinforce Brian's point. There's a phrase that says, "Think global, but act local." So it's fine, of course, to have a global vision, but you have to act locally because you have a market here that hasn't been exploited yet. I imagine that's what you mean, right?

[Brian Requarth - Male]
Exactly, yes. There are many things that can be done in business, but one thing is knowing how to prioritize what's super important today and what comes afterward tomorrow. You lack focus and clarity on what you need to do today to succeed in the future. So, for that reason, I'm out.

[Speaker 1 - Female]
Thank you.

[Alejandra Ríos - Female]
How much does intellectual property protection cost? These 300,000 pesos you're asking for, are you going to use all of it for that, or do you have other plans for that money?

[Speaker 1 - Female]
From adding augmented reality to the product, not only to make it more attractive but to increase its accessibility in terms of visual disability. I already have the prototype. The matter of digitizing my services and the issue of intellectual property.

[Alejandra Ríos - Female]
What you're doing is super important to me.

[Speaker 1 - Female]
Thank you.

[Alejandra Ríos - Female]
However, I see you lost in the business aspect. I don't see that you have clarity about why you need the money, and I don't see that you have a clear path on what you need to do to grow your business. And I think, the mission is incredible. I believe you are not the person to carry it out. And that's why I'm out.

[Speaker 1 - Female]
Okay.

[Marisa Lazo - Female]
Sofía, what worries me is that you are the one who does all the services. So that makes me see that it's very unlikely there will be scalability soon. I think you have a very good idea, a very original idea, but not good execution. And for that reason, I'm out.

[Speaker 1 - Female]
Thank you.

[Amaury Vergara - Male]
Sofía, let me tell you something. I think what's happening to you is not bad at all. I think you genuinely want to help, but you're still having trouble understanding, within all the range of things you do, how to focus your energy and attention on one thing. I'm going to offer you a second chance because I believe the way you presented the business to us today was not the most appropriate. And for those reasons, I'm out, but I offer that you reach out to me, let's say in six months, and hopefully at that time, you can show me that you have that ability to listen, that you tell me again how you're doing, what you've done in six months, and if I see that you are willing, then we'll talk and see how I can help you.

[Speaker 1 - Female]
Thank you.

[Marcus Dantus - Male]
Developing a board game is not that easy. I mean, the relatively simple part is what you did. There are a ton of issues you're missing. The business part isn't there. I offer to help you so that, in that second chance that Amaury is giving you, you present it very differently. And that's the support I offer you. But as an investor today, I'm out.
