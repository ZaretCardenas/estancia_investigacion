Hello, sharks. Jewelry is an art form defined by its interaction with the human body. It transforms, accentuates, and beautifies it. It has also been used as a symbol of status, power, and identity. We wanted to create something with our own signature and evoke that feeling of identity and belonging. That's why we created Calista. Calista is the creative side of Calista. We are Laura and Regina Hernández. I'm Laura, and I'm in charge of all the creative aspects of Calista.

[Speaker 2 - Female]
I handle all the administrative and commercial parts of the brand. Our brand is a contemporary design proposal that seeks to capture the magic of myths in jewelry.

[Speaker 1 - Female]
All our collections are inspired by myths and legends from around the world. So far, we've launched five collections, and today we've come to show you the two most recent ones. The Freya collection is inspired by one of the main goddesses of Norse mythology. She is the goddess of love, beauty, wealth, among many other things. The other collection is called Kuklim. It's inspired by a Mayan myth about a forbidden love story between a princess and a warrior. All our pieces are my creations, and we work with artisans here in Mexico City for our production. Everything is made of brass with 22-karat gold plating and natural stones.

[Speaker 2 - Female]
Currently, we have a lot of pieces and annual sales of one million pesos. So far this year, we've seen a 38% growth compared to last year. We sell in Mexico and abroad through our online store and various points of sale. We primarily export to the United States, Belgium, and England. And today, sharks, I invite you to break the myth that less is more. Because as we know in jewelry, more is always more. Invest with us, 700,000 pesos for 20% of our company. Well, we brought you some gifts. I hope you like them very much.

[Amaury Vergara - Male]
Thank you very much.

[Speaker 1 - Female]
You're welcome.

[Adriana Gallardo - Female]
Thank you very much.

[Marcus Dantus - Male]
Thank you.

[Speaker 1 - Female]
You're welcome.

[Adriana Gallardo - Female]
How lovely!

[Alejandro Litchi - Male]
Well then, let's talk business now. You mentioned one million in sales, total since you started or from last year?

[Speaker 2 - Female]
Last year.

[Marcus Dantus - Male]
With what profit?

[Speaker 2 - Female]
We have a gross margin of, um, 70%.

[Alejandro Litchi - Male]
Seventy percent? Including packaging and everything?

[Speaker 2 - Female]
Including packaging.

[Amaury Vergara - Male]
I want to ask you, what are you looking for besides the investment? From a shark? What are you seeking?

[Speaker 2 - Female]
Mainly to help us grow sales. I think we've had very good public acceptance, but we've had limited reach. I mean, we don't have the capital to invest in marketing to become a huge brand. But currently, in the press, you have the press numbers, but we're published a lot.

[Speaker 1 - Female]
I mean, since we started until now, we've appeared 119 times in magazines. Last year, we appeared 35 times, and in 2021, we appeared 41 times.

[Alejandra Ríos - Female]
Do you have your notes there?

[Speaker 1 - Female]
I wasn't going to remember.

[Marcus Dantus - Male]
How did you calculate the valuation?

[Speaker 2 - Female]
Multiple of sales. That is, five times sales.

[Marcus Dantus - Male]
Three and a half times last year's sales? Or this year's sales?

[Speaker 2 - Female]
Last year's sales.

[Alejandro Litchi - Male]
Can you tell me about your prices? For example, how much do you sell this bracelet for?

[Speaker 2 - Female]
2,990 pesos.

[Alejandro Litchi - Male]
2,990 pesos? Wow, you're not losing money! What's your average price approximately?

[Alejandro Litchi - Male]
About 1,600 pesos.

[Alejandro Litchi - Male]
1,600 pesos?

[Alejandra Ríos - Female]
Where do you produce?

[Speaker 1 - Female]
We produce here in Mexico City. We work with a workshop downtown. They, well, I make all the prototypes, and they help us with large-scale production.

[Adriana Gallardo - Female]
Are you in department stores?

[Speaker 1 - Female]
Not yet.

[Alejandra Ríos - Female]
Going back to the valuation, 3.5 times sales. Where did you get that number? Why that valuation?

[Speaker 2 - Female]
Well, let's see. We've been growing year over year by 70%, 60%. Looking at industry ranges and considering our growth, I arrived at that range.

[Alejandra Ríos - Female]
Industry ranges. I'm very curious about this way of valuing. When you say industry ranges, where did you get the range from? What average did you use? What type of companies did you consider?

[Speaker 2 - Female]
The fashion industry. And, well, ranges came up, I was researching various bibliographies. I think it's a level of sales we can reach in, I don't know, with the appropriate investment, I think we can achieve it in about three or four years.

[Alejandra Ríos - Female]
Speaking of the investment, what are you going to use the money you're asking for?

[Speaker 2 - Female]
Mainly marketing and inventory production.

[Adriana Gallardo - Female]
Do you work 100% on your business?

[Speaker 2 - Female]
Yes.

[Adriana Gallardo - Female]
Is there anyone else involved?

[Speaker 2 - Female]
Yes, we have another person who helps us with sales, and we also work with two people who handle all communication and press relations.

[Adriana Gallardo - Female]
So there are four of you.

[Speaker 2 - Female]
Five.

[Alejandro Litchi - Male]
Hey, I want to return to the product before getting into the numbers. They've already jumped ahead. How much does it cost you to make this one you told me is 2900 pesos? This bracelet?

[Speaker 2 - Female]
2990.

[Alejandro Litchi - Male]
How much are you selling it for?

[Speaker 2 - Female]
It costs us, I think, about 500 pesos.

[Alejandro Litchi - Male]
Wow, they're overcharging you. I think you can greatly improve your costs. Approximately how many pieces do you distribute per year?

[Speaker 2 - Female]
Last year, we sold a little over a thousand pieces.

[Alejandro Litchi - Male]
A thousand pieces in the whole year? Okay. Look, just roughly, this should cost you no more than 100 pesos. So I think you need to change your supplier. It's something I can offer you before we decide whether to get into the business or not.

[Adriana Gallardo - Female]
I don't think I'm the right person to help you. For that reason, I'm out.

[Speaker 2 - Female]
Thank you, Adriana.

[Amaury Vergara - Male]
Laura, Regina, frankly, I didn't quite connect with what you're seeking. I think you don't necessarily need a partner to solve the problem you have, but that's your decision. Therefore, I don't want to get in the way; I'm out.

[Speaker 2 - Female]
Thank you.

[Marcus Dantus - Male]
You know, I agree with Amaury. Probably what you need is a good digital marketing agency if that's what you're looking for. I'm sure that when you refer to a shark who can help you, it's me.

[Alejandro Litchi - Male]
Of course.

[Marcus Dantus - Male]
But in this case, I'm going to defer to Alejandro, who I'm sure can help you much more with his experience. And that's why I'm out.

[Alejandro Litchi - Male]
I'd like to get involved because I really liked you. I mean, if you want my support in manufacturing to lower costs, I can help you a lot. I can help you with marketing. And if in the future we see that we can make an investment with you, I would be delighted, but due to a conflict of interest, I can't do it. But I can support you, especially in making the jewelry with much better quality and much better prices. But for that reason, I'm out.

[Speaker 2 - Female]
Thank you very much.

[Alejandra Ríos - Female]
You're not going to get a better offer than the one you just received, or didn't receive, from Litchi with me. I wish you much success, but I'm out.
