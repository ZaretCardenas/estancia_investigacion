[Speaker 1 - Male]
Hello, sharks. My name is Bruno Velásquez.

[Speaker 2 - Female]
I'm Nayeli Cano.

[Speaker 1 - Male]
And we're here to present the Baika Rool project to you. Nayeli and I met at university. I was the only student there who rode a bicycle. So when I invited her out, the truth is, the only option for getting around was my bicycle. I added some rear footpegs.

[Adriana Gallardo - Female]
No way.

[Speaker 1 - Male]
Nayeli would stand on the footpegs, and we'd explore the historic center, visit restaurants, cafés, parks, or simply stroll around the city. That's when we realized that bicycles are truly an excellent way to spend incredible moments and create unforgettable stories. So, after finishing university, we decided to pool our substantial savings at the time, which were 25000 pesos, to buy ten bicycles and create this experience-based company where we could share our passion for cycling with others, allowing them to create these moments themselves.

[Speaker 2 - Female]
Our first and customers' favorite experience is the Picnic Rool, where we provide a bicycle so they can tour the city, or, in the case of our branch in Puerto Vallarta, along the Puerto Vallarta boardwalk, and end with a picnic in the forest or on the beach. Another experience we offer is the historical tour, where a guide accompanies them through the city's historic center, showcasing the architecture, culture, and rich history of that area. Or we simply provide bicycles so they can explore and create their own experiences.

[Speaker 1 - Male]
We started our first year in January 2021. In the first month of operations, we managed to recoup that significant investment I mentioned. Four months later, through the same effort, we opened a second branch in Puerto Vallarta. A year later, we opened a third branch in Mexico City. Over these two years, we've generated total sales of 1200000 pesos, of which 70% has been pure profit.

[Speaker 2 - Female]
We're seeking an investment of 400000 pesos for 15% of our company.

[Alejandro Litchi - Male]
Hey, tell us about the bicycles. Are they made in Mexico, or do you get them from elsewhere?

[Speaker 1 - Male]
The bicycles are Mexican-made.

[Alejandro Litchi - Male]
And is the model purely rental?

[Speaker 1 - Male]
Yes, it's rental. We also currently sell them at our physical locations.

[Alejandro Litchi - Male]
I saw you offer picnic options. So if I want to have a picnic, do I just rent the bike and you also handle the food, or...?

[Speaker 1 - Male]
Yes, we have options. At our Mexico City branch, the bicycles are adapted at the back to carry a picnic basket. So we place the picnic basket there and provide a suggested route on their phone. Since it's usually a couples' experience, you don't want a chaperone accompanying you the whole way. They follow the route on their phone, which takes them along the main bike paths in the city so they can ride safely and reach the forest to enjoy this experience wherever they prefer, with total freedom. We provide everything so they can enjoy their experience however they like.

[Amaury Vergara - Male]
Tell me a bit about the experiences. How do they differ from some of the well-known platforms that also offer new types of experiences?

[Speaker 2 - Female]
I think many of those experiences focus on foreigners. We do cater to that market, of course, but a large part of our audience is Mexican. So it's a new entertainment option that locals have chosen instead of going to the movies or other activities. We've enjoyed focusing on Mexican customers.

[Alejandra Ríos - Female]
How much does such an experience cost?

[Speaker 1 - Male]
We offer a very accessible price, 350 pesos for the picnic in Mexico City.

[Adriana Gallardo - Female]
For how long?

[Speaker 1 - Male]
A four-hour experience.

[Adriana Gallardo - Female]
And is the bike insured?

[Speaker 1 - Male]
As of today, they're not insured yet, but we're in talks with insurance companies to get coverage.

[Adriana Gallardo - Female]
So right now, you rent them out, and if they're stolen?

[Speaker 1 - Male]
We have the customers take responsibility through a promissory note for the value of the bicycles.

[Marcus Dantus - Male]
What if someone gets injured while using it?

[Speaker 1 - Male]
We have a liability waiver stating that users have the necessary skills and knowledge to undertake this experience, so they understand and assume responsibility.

[Alejandra Ríos - Female]
Bruno and Nayeli, how much did you sell in 2022, and how much do you expect to sell in 2023?

[Speaker 1 - Male]
In 2022, we sold 680000 pesos.

[Alejandra Ríos - Female]
So from 2021 to 2022, you actually grew by 10%?

[Speaker 1 - Male]
No, in 2021, we sold 360000 pesos.

[Alejandra Ríos - Female]
Then the numbers aren't adding up for me.

[Speaker 1 - Male]
So far this year, we've sold 170000 pesos.

[Adriana Gallardo - Female]
Oh, so you included everything.

[Speaker 1 - Male]
Exactly, total company sales.

[Adriana Gallardo - Female]
What will you do with the money?

[Speaker 1 - Male]
In Puerto Vallarta, we realized that this business is perfectly replicable in different cities because many places have beautiful monuments and parks where this activity can be enjoyed. So we want to open two new branches in Guadalajara and Oaxaca.

[Marcus Dantus - Male]
Bruno, Nayeli, let me ask you two specific questions. Who is the general manager?

[Speaker 1 - Male]
Well...

[Marcus Dantus - Male]
Or general manageress?

[Speaker 1 - Male]
It's me.

[Marcus Dantus - Male]
That's you. And is the company split 50-50?

[Speaker 1 - Male]
Yes.

[Marcus Dantus - Male]
What happens if you break up?

[Speaker 1 - Male]
Nayeli and I are very clear that we'll respect the division and continue the business.

[Marcus Dantus - Male]
Would you keep working together?

[Speaker 1 - Male]
Yes.

[Marcus Dantus - Male]
Do you currently supplement your income with legal work?

[Speaker 2 - Female]
Bruno does; I don't.

[Speaker 1 - Male]
I do.

[Alejandro Litchi - Male]
How much time do you dedicate to this?

[Speaker 1 - Male]
Right now, I'm truly very committed to this project.

[Adriana Gallardo - Female]
But you're not dedicating 100%?

[Alejandra Ríos - Female]
Bruno and Nayeli, I'm very concerned about the competition in this business and that your valuation is quite high, in my opinion. That makes me not fully convinced. So this venture isn't for me, and I'm out.

[Speaker 1 - Male]
Thank you very much.

[Marcus Dantus - Male]
There are many things I love and some I don't. You as a couple, great; your story is fantastic. I do think you're doing the right thing. I see potential in this, but I think you've come at a time that's too early to truly prove the model. That's why I'm out.

[Speaker 2 - Female]
Understood.

[Marcus Dantus - Male]
But I'd love to see you in the future.

[Speaker 1 - Male]
We will, I promise.

[Amaury Vergara - Male]
Bruno, Nayeli, I think what Marcus said is spot-on. You have the right profiles to be a great working team. I do think you've come a bit early for a shark like us, or at least for me, to say, "This is scalable; you're well-tested; you have an interesting operation, and I'd love to get involved in something where I see a big vision." Maybe you have it, I don't doubt it, and I truly wish you all the success. But for now, I'm out.

[Speaker 2 - Female]
Thank you.

[Adriana Gallardo - Female]
Well, listen, guys, I don't agree with them. I, like you, once went knocking on doors with that same hunger and dominant character you have, Bruno. When people tell you, "Your business has a lot of competition," or things like that, I heard that many times. And I am going to make you an offer.

[Alejandra Ríos - Female]
There we go.

[Adriana Gallardo - Female]
Because I like people who are daring and speak up. I know you're dying of nerves, filled with emotions, but when you have the drive to do something and face it head-on, I'm even noticing your body language; we're talking to you, and you're standing firm. So I'm going to make you an offer. It will be the 400000 pesos you're asking for, but for 20%. And I congratulate you.

[Speaker 2 - Female]
Thank you very much.

[Alejandro Litchi - Male]
Well, I'm the last one. I was also going to make you an offer, but it was more aggressive than Adriana's. But honestly, I loved you as entrepreneurs. The passion you have for what you do, you can tell you love it. I would have loved to get involved, truly. I was going to ask for a slightly higher percentage, but I don't want to put you in that situation. So I think you have a very good offer from Adriana. For that reason, I'm out, but otherwise, I would have joined in.

[Speaker 2 - Female]
Thank you very much. Thank you also for the feedback.

[Adriana Gallardo - Female]
So, what's your decision? Do we have a deal? Do we have a deal?

[Speaker 1 - Male]
Absolutely.
