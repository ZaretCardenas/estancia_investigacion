[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Hello sharks, we are Inia and Mónica, we are part of Novabori, a 100% Mexican company with a textile heritage of more than 100 years. Today, we are dedicated to creating fabrics and accessories from textile waste.

[Speaker 2 - Woman]
My family has been in the textile industry since the revolution, and in 2013 my brother told me, "I’m going to change the fashion industry in the world." He decided to make fabrics from textile recycling, using only natural fibers like cotton. We do not dye; we inherit the color from recycling, and finally, we support the local economy because we chose not to have a factory, instead working with existing factories in the state. At Novabori, we have two main business lines. The first represents 20% of our sales, where we make beautiful fabrics for fashion from textile recycling. The second business line is a brand called NuCycles, where we generate products from our own waste.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
In 2018, we managed to sell 300000 pesos; by 2022, we sold 2094000 pesos. Our goal for this year, which we are confident we will achieve, is 4 million pesos. Today, we are here to offer you 15% of our company for 1.5 million pesos.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Tell us a little more about the process.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
It is a process that does not use water, or uses very little water, because it's a mechanical process. The scrap arrives, the fabric is broken down, turned into fluff, spun again, and then woven on a semi-industrial loom.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
Now, not 100% of it is recycled.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
No, the percentage of recycled material is 69%, and 31% is virgin Mexican cotton. Let me explain why: when the fabric is broken down, the cotton fiber becomes shorter, making it harder to spin. So, it always needs reinforcement; in our case, we chose to use cotton.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
70% is a lot.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
Regarding your finished products, two questions: What is your star product, and what are your sales channels?

[Speaker 2 - Woman]
Ok, our star product is the nupech, which represents about 62% of the products we sell. Our main sales channel, which we call direct sales, is quite incredible. Our customers seek us out, sending direct messages, emails, or calls, and from there the sale begins. That represents 61% for us.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
Wow.

[Speaker 2 - Woman]
Another important channel for us is attending bazaars, fairs, and expos, which account for 32%. The remaining 7% that we need to exploit is e-commerce, our online store.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
And your profit margin?

[Speaker 2 - Woman]
We are around 56%.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Wow.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
Sorry if I missed this, but what does Novabori mean?

[Speaker 2 - Woman]
We did a market study on names, and my sister-in-law said, "we are going to get rich," and came up with Novabori. It has a misspelling, with the letter 'b.'

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
I imagined something else, haha.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Haha, you never expect that response: "we are going to get rich."

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
Haha.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
How do you prevent just any workshop from producing three more, putting a different label on them, and competing with you?

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Of course, the product is replicable, but the business model, the brand positioning we have, is what sets us apart.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
I’ll help you answer that question. You are the differentiator. Your values, your creativity, the way you've been innovating and using resources, that's what sets you apart.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Thank you very much.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
We really like your project, but I'm not hearing many offers.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
Inia, Moni, I want to make you an offer.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Go for it.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
I love it. These are the types of projects I like in the tank. I’ll offer you 1.5 million for 20% because I think the valuation is a bit high, and I’m leaving room for another shark to join.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
I really like the company. Building a brand in this area is very difficult, and it seems like you've done it. I would love to join Amaury, but I still think the valuation is high. I’d like to lower Amaury’s valuation to 5 million pesos, which is still more than twice last year's sales. That would be 1.5 million for 30%, if Amaury agrees and we can share the ticket.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
I’m sticking with my valuation, Karla.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
I offer 30%; I think I have a lot to contribute. Not sure if anyone else wants to join my offer.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Your quality is impressive. I was surprised and proud to see that you're Mexican. I think you have two good offers today in the tank, and for that reason, I’m out.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Thank you very much.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
I’ve worked on other projects with other sharks, but with this one, I think I can help you a lot. I’m not leaving room for anyone else. I'm going solo.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Good, because we didn’t want to join anyway. Moni and Ignia, I think you have great offers. I’ll definitely be in touch once you have a shark on board to help you make connections in the textile industry and find more clients. But for now, I’m out.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Thank you, Ale.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
What a proud moment, seeing a company like yours, with so many values and philosophy behind it, with such a fun name. I think Amaury’s offer is very good. I would love to be involved in helping you in any way I can, even as an advisor, without taking any shares.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
So, you’re okay with Amaury’s offer, but not mine?

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
You can choose freely. But as an investor, I’m out.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
I’m sensing a lot of hostility. First, Amaury didn’t invite me; second, they didn’t take my offer; and third, Marcus...

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
I disagree with your valuation, Karla. There’s nothing wrong with that; it’s not hostility.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
In fact, I’ll improve it. My offer stands at 25%.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
We’ll go with Amaury because he believed in us.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
Do we have a deal?

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
We have a deal.
