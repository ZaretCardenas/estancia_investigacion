[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Hello, sharks. My name is Valentina. I am a communications and marketing specialist.

[Speaker 2 - Man]
I am Carlos. I am a biologist and a doctor. And we are the founders of Valchini.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Amaury, you have a list of ingredients that I'd like you to read aloud, please.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
Oxybenzone, avobenzone, homosalate, octisalate, octocrylene, methylparaben, bemotrizinol, retinyl palmitate.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Would you consume these ingredients?

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
No way.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Okay, those are the ingredients used to make a conventional chemical sunscreen. This is the main reason why we created Valchini. Valchini is a brand that is changing the vision of sun care. Eight years ago, we needed to find a natural, effective, and resistant solution because we surf. Then we realized the market opportunity and professionalized our business, creating this line of sunscreens. Today, we have sunscreens for sports, daily use, and for children.

[Speaker 2 - Man]
We started in 2014 making the sunscreen for ourselves and our friends in a homemade way. In 2017, we decided to formalize. We launched the brand and began sales, which at that time were only at physical points of sale across the country. In 2020, we started online commerce, selling both in stores and online, and sold 200000 pesos. In 2021, we began to grow the team and achieved sales of 400000 pesos. By 2022, we reached 600000 pesos. At the end of that year, we included the line of solar harmonizers, as we call them, along with the sunscreens. So far this year, we have already sold double compared to the same months last year. That's why we are offering you 15% of our company for 300000 pesos and your expertise. So, who among you wants to swim in clean seas with us?

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Before we start with questions, can we distribute these boxes?

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Of course, we'd love to see the consistency and everything. Yes, absolutely.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
Thank you, my friend.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
How lovely. Thank you.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
Thank you.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Karla?

[Karla Berman - Woman]
Oh, look how cute.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Thank you.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Do you regularly sell them in this box, or is this something special for promotion?

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
That's special.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Okay. Where do you manufacture them? Do you already have a plant, or are you outsourcing the production?

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
We have a laboratory.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Your own?

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Yes. That's one of the strengths we feel we have. We're involved in all the brand's processes. We really know the brand very well, from formulation, research, herbalism, plants, nature, to usage.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
Who is your buyer persona?

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Well, we have three personas: the ecologist, who is focused on environmental health; then we have the athlete; and then we have people oriented towards, mostly women, skin care.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
Do you have many more products besides these, or are these the only ones?

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
This is the line for now.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
Carlos, does this have medical validation?

[Speaker 2 - Man]
Yes, it does. To sell a cosmetic product and a sunscreen, you need tests for irritability, allergenicity, and SPF.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
I didn't quite understand, I get the environmental damage when you go into the sea. What is the risk to the human body?

[Speaker 2 - Man]
In the human body, what's been found is that these substances are absorbed, and many of these ingredients have hormonal effects. They're considered hormone disruptors that act like estrogen, creating alterations, especially in women and children.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
But what happens if you use them?

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Well, they are hormone disruptors, so you end up with a hormonal imbalance, which can lead to diseases.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
Do you have a company? Do you sell as a company, or do you sell as...?

[Speaker 2 - Man]
As individuals.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
Ah, okay.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
Hey guys, I have a question. Depending on your answer, I might tell you if I'm interested in making an offer. Would you be open to collaborating, doing something in partnership with our cosmetics line and launching a product together? First, I want to know if yes or no. Obviously, we'd have to discuss details and all that.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
It depends.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
Honestly, I loved the brand, your values, and how you presented it. I think you need to improve the way you communicate it to the general public. The product sells itself. I'm going to make you an offer. I'll offer you the 300,000 pesos for 20%.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
I also want to make you an offer. I always say that product comes first, then brand. You have both, a good product with a very beautiful brand. The product is super good, very smooth, it blends into the skin. You don't feel like you have a layer on, which often happens with sunscreens. It has no scent, or just a very soft, subtle one. I offer you exactly what you're asking for: 300,000 pesos for 15%.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
Oh!

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Wow!

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
Wait, hold on, because I asked you a question.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
And, and, and, I would let you remain independent as you are, with your product that you already like and the way you're working, whereas with him, you'd have to enter a big company.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
Valentina, what does it depend on?

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
We are not willing to sacrifice our values.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
Look, precisely because we share the same values, I'd like to collaborate with you. I would never, ever ask you to compromise your values because that would go against my own values. I would give you the money you're seeking for 15%; however, after we establish the collaboration agreement and achieve objectives in this collaboration, I will return your shares once I recover my investment. And you go your way, and we go ours.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Marcus, would you be willing to add me to your offer? We lower it a bit, to 16%. Eight and eight, 150000 pesos each.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
Agreed, but let me tell you something. I think you need to develop your company. First, you need to create a company. You need to grow it, develop your brand. You have a good path ahead, and I think you should pursue it. Amaury's offer is great, not Marisa's, but Amaury's is. And you need to think if you're ready, at such a young age, to join such a big company.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
That's why mine is good if you're not ready for that.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
Marisa's isn't good.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Of course it is.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
But I think there's still a lot to develop, and I happily accept Ale as a partner because that's our forte, developing companies.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
I disagree with Marcus. I think I'm a great shark for you, and I'll tell you why. One, I get very involved with the entrepreneurs I support. And two, I'm an expert in taking something artisanal to something huge.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
Look, if you want an easy partner who will shower you with compliments and tell you everything you do well, you can choose. I have a lot of experience analyzing these kinds of products, and I would be a much tougher partner. I think your product is lacking in many ways. You need a much cleaner image. You need claims that are credible. But I like the product content. I offer you 300,000 pesos for 30% of the company. It's a valuation of 1.5 times sales, which is still generous for a consumer product.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
What are you going to do, guys?

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Well, to start, it's super difficult to decide. There's great admiration for all of you, obviously. But for some more than others.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
Valentina, before you answer, I'm going to change things up a bit.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Oh no.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
That's not fair, is it?

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Yes, of course.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
Yes, it's allowed, anything is possible in the tank. Look, but I think this will help your decision-making. I want to collaborate with you. I'm stepping out of the offer in the sense that I won't offer you money or ask for a percentage. I condition my collaboration on you partnering with other sharks. The decision of which sharks is up to you. In theory, if you get an offer, I'm already in, so to speak, if you want my collaboration.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
But as a project, you're out.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
As an investor, I'm out.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Okay.

[Speaker 2 - Man]
Well, we are very flattered.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
We're going to go with Ale and Marcus, double guidance.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
Do we have a deal?

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Deal.
