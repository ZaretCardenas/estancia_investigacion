Hello, sharks. I'm Ilana.

[Speaker 2 - Female]
And I'm Lisa.

[Speaker 1 - Female]
And we're sisters, partners, sisters-in-law, and moms. Together, we are Stroller Wash. As parents, we're always worried about washing the sheets, blankets, clothes, toys. But why not give the same importance to these items where children spend so much time every day? So one day, we found ourselves in the middle of the pandemic battling tooth and nail, both against one of our strollers. We looked at each other and said, "How is there no one who does this?"

[Speaker 2 - Female]
Well, let me tell you a bit about what Stroller Wash is. It's a company specialized in washing and disinfecting all kinds of baby items. Our service is specifically at home. From pickup to delivery, it's a maximum of three days, and we also offer express services. In the proof of concept we have today, we're able to know practically all the brands, as well as the engineering and assembly of each of their parts. We know the products and also all the processes that lead us to achieve the best result. In 2022, our sales were 550000 pesos and more, with a profit margin of 30%. We have projected sales for 2023 between 800000 and 1 million pesos, also increasing our profit margin by 5 to 10%. We know perfectly well that we have a small business, and we are more than ready to take it to another level. Well, for this, we are asking for 950000 pesos for 15% of our company.

So, tell me about the other items, because I understand the stroller seems like a difficult item to clean. I imagine that's where you started, also because of the name. But what other items?

[Speaker 2 - Female]
It involves all baby items, especially portable ones like strollers, car seats, baby carriers, bassinets, travel cribs, high chairs.

[Marisa Lazo - Female]
How many collaborators do you have? What's your team like? Tell us a bit more.

[Speaker 1 - Female]
Led by the two of us. Nowadays, we already have a person who supports us a lot as a coordinator of the whole process. One cleaning person, there are several washing stages, but there's one person who does all the hand washing and the entire subsequent process. And a person in charge of pickups and deliveries.

[Amaury Vergara - Male]
What's the current reach of your business? Are you in Mexico City?

[Speaker 2 - Female]
We are, yes.

[Amaury Vergara - Male]
And do you have any service radius?

[Speaker 1 - Female]
Yes, like the metropolitan area. Sometimes we don't go out, sometimes we do. We also have drop-off. Many people, when they're outside our area, actually come to us. We are located in the western zone, and they come to us because they see they need it, right?

[Brian Requarth - Male]
Ilana and Lisa, my concern is, why do you need to hire a service for that? I'd love to know a bit more about whether this is a vitamin or a real headache that exists.

[Speaker 1 - Female]
We always talk a lot on our social networks about the maintenance of these items. Because yes, children have impressive abilities to make these spaces messy. However, what we do is go to a depth that you can't reach at home. I have many friends who tell me, "I already put it in the washing machine." And I tell them, "Send it to me. That's not possible."

[Alejandra Ríos - Female]
How much do you charge for this service for a normal stroller?

[Speaker 2 - Female]
It ranges from 400 pesos to 600 pesos.

[Brian Requarth - Male]
What's the frequency of orders?

[Speaker 2 - Female]
Our recommendation is washing every three months, right? We have clients who have been with us for over a year who bring them to us once a month. We try to avoid being that opportunistic company that says, "You have to wash it every two weeks because it suits me as a business." No. The reality is that to maintain the fabrics well, the quality, and to still cover this safety protection, all the elements of a car seat, for example, it would indeed be every three months.

[Amaury Vergara - Male]
Ilana, Lisa, unfortunately, I don't have children, and it's hard for me to relate to the product. And I don't think I'm the right shark to help you. Therefore, I'm out.

[Speaker 2 - Female]
Thank you very much.

[Brian Requarth - Male]
It's a hyper-local business. What's hyper-local? It means you have to have services more centered in certain neighborhoods or regions. What I would do is a comparative market analysis of what laundry companies do, right? I think you can be very inspired by what they're doing, how they do it. I think housewives, moms who work a lot, that's probably your potential market. It's not my market, who I am. So, for that reason, I'm out.

[Speaker 2 - Female]
Thank you.

[Marcus Dantus - Male]
I love projects that solve a problem, that solve it with differentiation, with innovation. I think this also becomes more relevant after the pandemic.

[Speaker 1 - Female]
Exactly.

[Marcus Dantus - Male]
However, your market is very limited because your prices are prohibitive. It costs more to wash a stroller than to wash a car, even detailing the car. So, I definitely think your target is the upper class, who usually have people who help them with cleaning, who can also do this service, perhaps not as professionally. Maybe what worries me most is the part about barriers to entry, that someone could copy your business. I'd love to help you think a little more about how to make this perhaps even a franchisable business. But for the moment you're in and for the valuation you have, I'm out.

[Marisa Lazo - Female]
To me, the price doesn't seem so high because you don't wash, you wash the car once or twice a week, and if it's rainy season, even more. This you're going to do every three or four months. So maybe you're going to pay for it three times a year. Paying 400 pesos three times a year isn't so burdensome if they're going to do such a deep cleaning. I recommend that you grow more with yourselves, with your own investments, reinvesting and reinvesting and growing your team, and opening in other parts of the city. That seems definitely super necessary to me. But do it on your own. You're doing very well. I personally think you don't need an investor at this time but to continue because you're doing well. Keep all the percentage of your company. And for all those reasons, I'm out.

[Alejandra Ríos - Female]
Ilana and Lisa, first of all, I want to congratulate you. Being an entrepreneur is hard enough. It's a path with many obstacles. And being moms and doing that work is even more complicated. It's a titanic task. And the fact that you are doing it and have been growing this project over the last two years is something to celebrate and congratulate you for. For now, honestly, the valuation seemed very high to me. I think you're doing very well. Keep it up, congratulations. But I'm out.
