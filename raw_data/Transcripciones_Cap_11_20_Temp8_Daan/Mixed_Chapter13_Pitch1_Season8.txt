Currently, 99% of the caps sold in Mexico are made in Asia, so consumers have limited options in terms of design and, in some cases, even quality. After 10 years of experience in cap manufacturing, I found it necessary to perfect my tailoring techniques, so I traveled to China for training. It was there that I became convinced that it was possible to manufacture quality caps in Mexico as well. I am Kiblo.

[Speaker 2 - Male]
I'm Pablo, and we're here to present your new favorite caps made in Mexico: Kiblo Caps.

[Speaker 1 - Female]
In January 2022, we launched Kiblo Caps. We decided it would be a premium cap brand focused on quality and design.

[Speaker 2 - Male]
In our first collection, we defined our characteristic details, such as genuine leather clasps, interior colors, and packaging. Currently, we have five collections. Each collection has its own palette of colors and textures, giving us a total of 29 products. We closed our first year of sales with 1035473 pesos, with a net margin of 38%. Today, Sharks, we come to offer you 15% of Kiblo in exchange for 650000 pesos, plus all your experience in the business world, your connections, and your good ideas.

[Speaker 1 - Female]
But before closing the deal, let me present your new favorite caps.

[Amaury Vergara - Male]
Thank you.

[Speaker 2 - Male]
You're welcome.

[Adriana Gallardo - Female]
Thank you.

[Speaker 2 - Male]
You're welcome.

[Alejandro Litchi - Male]
Thank you.

[Speaker 2 - Male]
And the Primeless.

[Alejandra Ríos - Female]
Thank you.

[Speaker 1 - Female]
How beautiful.

[Adriana Gallardo - Female]
It matches me and everything.

[Speaker 1 - Female]
Of course.

[Alejandro Litchi - Male]
Hey, Kiki, are the materials also made in Mexico?

[Speaker 1 - Female]
The material is not made in Mexico.

[Speaker 2 - Male]
Not entirely. Not entirely. There are some, there are some that are.

[Alejandro Litchi - Male]
For example, the leather, I imagine you make it. Is this leather or imitation leather?

[Speaker 1 - Female]
Actually, the leather is synthetic suede.

[Alejandro Litchi - Male]
Ah, okay.

[Speaker 1 - Female]
It's imported. The textiles we use, we try to ensure they are from the Americas. I mean, we want to avoid products made in China at all costs.

[Alejandra Ríos - Female]
How much of what you sell is online, and how much is in the stores where you send the product and it's sold there?

[Speaker 1 - Female]
Okay, the percentage of online sales is 10%.

[Alejandra Ríos - Female]
Okay.

[Speaker 1 - Female]
90% of the sales were wholesale.

[Amaury Vergara - Male]
So, tell us a bit about your strategy. How soon are you going to release a new collection? How are you launching them, what's the frequency of your releases?

[Speaker 2 - Male]
We have, the great advantage is that we control the factory here, so...

[Adriana Gallardo - Female]
I like that.

[Speaker 2 - Male]
We have quite a bit of flexibility with that. We make small launches. Other brands have to do launches of at least 500 pieces. We can do launches with 25 pieces to see, to test. Currently, our next step is to go to the United States, so we'll also face a new challenge there.

[Alejandro Litchi - Male]
Do you already have contacts in the United States to...?

[Speaker 2 - Male]
Currently, I reside in the United States. The idea was to take Kiblo there, have a warehouse there. We started the same way, with our online store plus seeking boutiques.

[Marcus Dantus - Male]
Hey, Pablo, I'm going to ask you a tricky question...

[Speaker 2 - Male]
Okay.

[Marcus Dantus - Male]
As a marketing expert, I want to understand your process in arriving at the brand. I mean, did you go through Paki and then Kiblo, or how?

[Speaker 2 - Male]
Actually, no, no. Paki was eliminated from the first round because it didn't rhyme. In fact, we did a focus group with two names.

[Alejandra Ríos - Female]
Were they Paki and Kiblo?

[Speaker 2 - Male]
No, no, it was Kiblo and Capture One.

[Alejandra Ríos - Female]
Are you already in department stores?

[Speaker 2 - Male]
No.

[Alejandra Ríos - Female]
Why not?

[Speaker 2 - Male]
We haven't found the door yet.

[Alejandra Ríos - Female]
I really like the product. I think it's very cool; it's of very good quality, but certain things worry me. The brand, to be honest, I have to say, I don't love it, and I don't see that you're aiming for sustainable materials in the brand. So, although I love your product and think you could do very well, I'm out. But good luck.

[Speaker 2 - Male]
Thank you very much, Ale.

[Amaury Vergara - Male]
I want to share my stance with you. The truth is that my only big problem is that they seem very similar to a brand that's already well-known. I see it and say, "Ah, it looks like this brand." I think you need to seek a bit more differentiation; otherwise, it will be very difficult to position yourselves because these brands are global and very aggressive. They come from the United States and are very well established, very well introduced in Mexico. For that reason, I think I can't offer you anything better, and I'm out. I wish you much success.

[Adriana Gallardo - Female]
I identify a lot with both of you, for the hunger you have to do something. I remember when I started, I went to the United States with nothing. At 18 years old too, without papers, without money, without speaking English. And the guidance I had, my mother, was key to my growth. I also like that you say you need help, that you want to learn more about leadership, about growing as entrepreneurs.

[Alejandro Litchi - Male]
I'm going to make you an offer now, enough talk.

[Adriana Gallardo - Female]
Excuse me. So, are you willing to be flexible, adapt, and learn that part of the market?

[Speaker 2 - Male]
It's something I learned in school. In school, they teach you to be stubborn, to have a very clear concept, which now I understand in the business world. The one who commands is the public. At the end of the day, we want sales; at the end of the day, we want the caps to sell, more than having a cap on my head that I like. So I want to sell; I want the public to want to buy from me.

[Alejandro Litchi - Male]
Well, the offer would be, you came asking for 650000 pesos for 15%. For me to get involved properly, I would ask for the same 650000 pesos for 20%. And in addition, a 2% of sales until I recover my 650000 pesos. Once I recover it, I keep 1% of sales, and here's what I can offer you. I can help you a lot with everything online, entering the United States, I have business in the U.S., and that's basically my offer.

[Speaker 1 - Female]
Very well.

[Speaker 2 - Male]
Thank you very much.

[Marcus Dantus - Male]
I think a lot can be done, but my offer wasn't going to be as generous. I think Alejandro's offer is better. So why distract you? As they say, that's why I'm out.

[Speaker 2 - Male]
Thank you very much.

[Speaker 1 - Female]
Thank you very much, Marcus.

[Adriana Gallardo - Female]
Well, I'm going to make you an offer. My offer will be the same 650,000, but I'm going to ask for 25%. And how will I help you? In everything, from yourselves, your own confidence, leadership, negotiation, sales. That's my offer.

[Marcus Dantus - Male]
So you have two offers: 650000 for 20% plus a small percentage of sales that then drops to 1%.

[Speaker 1 - Female]
Two and then drops to one.

[Alejandro Litchi - Male]
Two, I recover, and then I keep the one forever.

[Marcus Dantus - Male]
650,000 for 25%. Do you want to think about it?

[Speaker 2 - Male]
Adriana, we want to thank you, truly. We believe you are someone to look up to. But as we're all in agreement, Alejandro, it's a great offer. We have a deal.
