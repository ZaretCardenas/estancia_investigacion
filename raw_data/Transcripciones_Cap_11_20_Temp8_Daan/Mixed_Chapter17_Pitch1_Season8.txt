[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Hello, sharks. We are Alexa and Efrén, and together we are Moonbeats. I'm going to ask you to close your eyes for a moment. Find the most comfortable position possible, relax your body, and slowly and gently become aware of your body. And when you feel ready, open your eyes and return. This calm you just experienced is the origin of Moobeats, a space dedicated not only to healing but also to the training and support of thousands of people around the world who are seeking well-being. Through classes, courses, workshops, and training programs, we have been creating a multiplying effect, healing not only individuals but families. With our sales of 4.1 million since we started in October 2020, we have managed to create a multiplying effect that has allowed us to reach spaces that are still unknown in the holistic world.

[Speaker 2 - Man]
We are seeking an investment of one million pesos for a 10% stake in Moobeats. We want this to open a digital village, which we believe is the next step for Moobeats. In this place, we will offer a full range of services, such as workshops, courses, and many more services that can be found within the platform digitally, not only that, but also streaming content and material that users can read in a more comfortable way.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
So, Alexa and Efrén, it's not very clear to me how you work because you talk about something physical in a studio and then about streaming and virtual offerings.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Sure, on one hand, we have the physical space where we offer yoga classes, meditation courses, and workshops. What we are now seeking is to create a digital village where we can bring together other professionals in holistic, mental, and emotional health, offering a much broader range of possibilities so that you, as a user, can access this platform through a monthly membership, like any streaming service, and access different types of courses, workshops, and resources that help your well-being.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
How much are you thinking of charging for this membership?

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
We are thinking of charging 300 pesos. This is mainly due to the type of content that will be on the platform and because if you compare it with what it costs to attend, for example, a meditation session in any space in the city, you would be well below the usual range while having access to a greater number of services.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
Are these courses meant to train someone to become, perhaps, a therapist or facilitator of some of these therapies? Or is it simply for users?

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Our signature course, let's say the jewel in our crown, is called Training in Guiding Holistic Ceremonies and Rituals, where we train men and women who wish to hold supportive spaces for celebrations, from birthdays to blessing ways and all these ceremonies you might have seen around. We train them to have all the foundations they need to guide these spaces responsibly. This course is divided into three levels. Each level lasts four months, and you progress accordingly, all in line with accompanying groups and individuals.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
I see that you provide therapies or healing services. Could you tell us a bit about your background?

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Sure. I have a master's degree in psychotherapy. I studied sound healing and sonotherapy. Additionally, I am initiated as a healer, a traditional doctor, by the Shipibo-Konibo tribe in the Amazon.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
But do your students provide therapy?

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Some do.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Is there anything else like this in the market, Alexa?

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Not in Mexico. In the United States, there are some platforms with similar offerings, but they're not the same.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
Alexa, Efrén, how can you show me that this is truly attractive to a sector when I, as a user, frankly don't consume this type of content digitally?

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
It's about broadening the perspective to this range of possibilities. There are many opportunities within the world of well-being. Understanding that while the physical experience may often seem better, it doesn't mean that the digital experience can't emulate the quality of the physical one.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
Alexa, Efrén, I love your purpose, but what you see as a strength, that diversification, I see as a weakness. You're asking us for money to start a business you don't know. It worries me when entrepreneurs try to do too many things at once. I'm out.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Thank you. Thank you very much.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
Alexa, Efrén, I think the business you have is nice. It's wonderful to dedicate yourselves to this, and it's clear you're very passionate about it. The downside, I interpret it the same way, you are trying to start a business with our money where we take the risk, and it's something you don't seem to know well yet. The other issue for me is that, indeed, there are a lot of platforms in Latin America that do this. In fact, I invested in one. So, I'm out.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Thank you. Thank you.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Alexa and Efrén, I am a big believer in the importance of mental health. I'm a psychologist, and my master's is in psychoanalytic psychotherapy. That's why I know how delicate it is to provide therapy. You're very well-prepared, Alexa. But it worries me and seems extremely delicate that you're training and preparing other people who don't have a formal degree. It seems like a great responsibility to let them go out and provide therapy. Additionally, your valuation is very high. That's why I'm out.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Thank you. Thank you very much.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
I differ a bit with Marisa. I think the fact that you offer training, as I heard, they're very comprehensive courses lasting several months.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
A person who provides therapy needs to complete a four-year degree, and then, to be a psychotherapist, you have to pursue a master's degree. You can't provide therapy with a course of six, nine, or three months.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
But the courses aren't meant to turn them into therapists. From what I understand, the training you offer is for sound therapies, meditations.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
In fact, they're to guide ceremonies, hold circles. I have some students who are therapists. That's why the answer is yes, some provide therapy, not because I've given them permission to do so, but because many psychologists, psychotherapists, and others dedicated to alternative therapies in different fields come to me.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
Alexa, if I remember correctly, you mentioned that you offer healing therapies.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Yes, I did mention that, but...

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
And you didn't clarify that only those who were already prepared, but that you accept students.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
That was my mistake, but I don't train therapists as such.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Alexa and Efrén, I think what sets you apart in the market is the training you provide to prepare people who can conduct these ceremonies. It greatly concerns me that you want to shift your model to a subscription model. It doesn't make sense to me. I hope you have the experience to do it; I hope I'm wrong. That's why I'm out.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Thank you. Thank you very much.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
Alexa, Efrén, first of all, congratulations, and I'm very pleased you're here because it speaks to the evolution of this type of company and centers that ultimately aim to help people. You have a membership model you're considering at 300 pesos per month. If you think about all the expenses people have, or that we have, like phone bills, home internet, entertainment streaming services, it all adds up to a significant monthly expense. Adding 300 more pesos puts you in that competitive space, and it's a very aggressive competition. For now, I don't think you fully convinced me on the business side. I wish you much success; unfortunately, I'm out.
