Hello sharks. I'm Jorge Albarrán, a radiologist. On November 8, 1895, William Colonel Rogen discovered X-rays. The first X-ray was taken of his wife, and it took more than 25 minutes to take and develop. Nowadays, we can take an X-ray in 5 to 7 seconds and have it on your phone or email within 30 minutes, complete with a diagnosis. For over 30 years, I’ve been taking X-rays, and I’ve noticed that a high percentage of patients have some kind of movement limitation. These patients often have to rent an ambulance or use their own vehicle to get an X-ray, which can cause them further harm. That’s why I’m here to negotiate with you: 2.5 million pesos for 20% of mobile digital radiology.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
What makes this way of taking X-rays different from what’s already available?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
We come to your home, and no hospital is currently delivering an interpretation in less than 30 minutes like we do.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
How much did you say you sold last year?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Last year, 7 million 300 thousand pesos.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Marcos, do you have screws in your knee?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
We could take an X-ray right here in the comfort of your tank.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
Of course.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Ah, good one.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
This device is made from cesium. Therefore, we use only 30% of the radiation that a conventional radiology machine uses.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
Ready?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Ready.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
Wow!

[Speaker 1 - Man]
We wait a few seconds, and here we have it, total knee replacement.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
There you go! Proof that it’s real.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
The advantage over conventional X-rays is that X-rays are static images, and we usually have to view them under a small or large light to see the definition. With these machines, we can adjust the density and see more bone tissue, soft tissue, or even the skin.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
Jorge, what’s your vision for this? Is it to keep the business as it is, or are you thinking about expanding services?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
One of the new regulations, the 030 standard, says that companies must give their employees a check-up. So, with your help, which I’m sure we can get, we can go to companies to take these types of X-rays. Employees won’t have to go to a hospital for a check-up. We can do it in their office, and it takes less than 10 minutes for an X-ray and lab tests. We’re talking about contracts for 3,000, 5,000, or even 7,000 X-rays.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
But do check-ups include X-rays?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
All check-ups include an X-ray. Even the most basic, with blood chemistry, blood count, and an EKG, must include an X-ray, which lets us check the lungs and, for instance, if you have hypertension, if your heart is enlarged.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
And who’s your competition?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
We have several competitors. Fortunately, we’ve taken, I believe, over 25% to 30% of the X-rays in the city.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
And what sets you apart from your competitors?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Our response time. Let me show you our new equipment. For elderly patients who’ve just had an accident, we can arrive in less than 30 minutes and help decide whether the patient can stay at home or if we need to take them to a hospital because it might be a fracture.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
Could anyone who buys this equipment do something similar?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Yes, but they’d need some experience in taking X-rays. It’s not the same as taking an X-ray in a hospital where the equipment and table are fixed, and you have to rotate the patient to fit the machine. Here, as you can see, we can angle it in all directions to take the X-ray.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
But is the quality the same?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Equal to or better than a hospital.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
So, the innovation here, Jorge, is that these are mobile, in-home X-rays, because I’ve seen this kind of equipment before.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Yes, but no one delivers an interpretation in 30 minutes, no hospital.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
But Jorge, there are handheld devices that take X-rays, like ones the size of a phone.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Yes, but they don’t have the resolution of these machines. Those small machines exist, but they can only take images of small structures like elbows, hands, knees, and feet. They require minimal radiation.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
Jorge, how much does one of these machines cost?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Altogether, around 50,000 to 75,000 dollars.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
And how much does the service cost?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
On average, 1,100 pesos.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
And how much does the same X-ray cost at a hospital or clinic?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
700, maybe 800 pesos.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
Jorge, maybe you don’t need a partner. Maybe with a good loan, you could expand your business. At least, you haven’t convinced me why you specifically need me. I think it’s a great tool for elderly people, but I don’t see myself as an investor in this kind of project, so I’m out. I wish you the best of luck.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Jorge, for me, the issue is the barriers to entry. Why? You have big competitors in this industry.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
No doubt.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
And beyond that, I don’t know how I could help you. This is an industry I know nothing about. I’m not passionate about the project, even though I love what you’re doing. So, I’m out.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Thank you, thank you for listening to me.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Jorge, I think this is a very good solution, and I do believe people will pay extra to get this done at home.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
Jorge, I love your service. I want you to give me your phone number. I have a wonderful grandmother who’s over 90 years old. Just last week, we had a problem, and it was painful for her to move. My background is investing in businesses that can grow 10X with relative ease. And I see that the human touch you provide is very important. So, as a patient, I’m in, but as an investor, I’m out.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
I applaud you. The fact that after 30 years as a radiologist, you decided to become an entrepreneur is commendable. Entrepreneurs should do something that makes them happy, solves a problem, and improves the environment. And I can see that this makes you happy. But I don’t see myself as happy investing and working in something related to this field, and for that reason, I’m out.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
Jorge, let me tell you where I stand. I have two problems. The first is that I think you’re going against the trend. I don’t see a big market for home radiography services. I see this as a business where you’ll undoubtedly make money, you’re already making money. But I don’t see it as a business where I, as an investor, could eventually have a financial exit and make money. And for that reason, I’m out.
