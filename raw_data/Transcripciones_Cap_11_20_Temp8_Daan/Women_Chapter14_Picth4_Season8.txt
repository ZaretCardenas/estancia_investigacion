[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Hello, Sharks. I'm Norma Hernández, and I represent Ambiente Mexicano, a company dedicated to designing and producing executive gifts featuring Mexican handicrafts. Through the corporate gifts we design with our artisans, we boost the economy of 27 indigenous families who are treated with respect and receive fair payments. We also support them in certain phases of their work, especially when they are figuring out costs. Our work acts as a sort of bridge, an artisan-company bridge. Because through these gifts, we aim to educate people about the value of Mexican handicrafts. We do this by explaining the entire history of the pieces, their value, how they're made, and how long they take. And we do it in both English and Spanish. Along with the explanation, there's also a video in Zapotec narrated by the artisans who work with us. You can see them there, carving the pieces, painting them, making them, everything. By doing this, we'll help more artisans have better incomes and improve their quality of life. If we grow, they'll obviously grow too. And to do this, we mainly need two things. First, to improve what we do. And second, to promote our work. We can achieve it, but obviously with your support. And with an approximate investment of 250000 pesos in exchange for 12.5% of our company. So finally, our question is, would you like to support us and be the promoters of a new generation of patrons of Mexican folk art? And before you answer, well, we have some gifts for you so you can see them up close and get a better idea of what we do.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
Thank you very much, Norma.

[Oso Trava - Man]
Let me help you.

[Alejandro Litchi - Man]
Where's the business for you? What percentage do you keep on each product they make?

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
On average, all the products leave us with approximately 35 to 40% profit. We never say to them, "Hey, I'm going to buy a lot, give me a discount." We never do that. We take the handicrafts at the price they set. We never, ever haggle with them. And if we see they're losing money, we crunch numbers with them so they don't lose out and always want to work with us.

[Alejandro Litchi - Man]
I love that.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
These alebrijes are so beautiful.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Oh, I'm glad you like them. Those are alebrijes from Oaxaca, from the Ortega family.

[Oso Trava - Man]
Norma, how much did you sell last year?

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Last year, 2022, we were a bit down; we were around one million.

[Oso Trava - Man]
And before the pandemic, what was your best year?

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Our best year was between 2018 and 2019, where we were selling close to two and a half million.

[Alejandro Litchi - Man]
Are the boxes also made by artisans from Oaxaca?

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
We make the boxes ourselves; we design them according to the clients' needs and what they want to include. But all the lids are decorated with amate paper, hand-painted. And the amate is made with the same recipe that was used to make the amate of the Aztec codices, for example.

[Alejandro Litchi - Man]
How many different items or SKUs do you have?

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
We have around 60.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
And would you say that the goal, besides making money and all, is to professionalize the artisans?

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Yes. In fact, that's what we wanted to do from the beginning. We know that, for example, corporate gifts are dominated by promotional items. But we also want people to see that this can compete at the level of any other high-quality product.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
Norma, let me tell you that this type of project excites me a lot. I like them because they have a social purpose. I like you as an entrepreneur.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Thank you.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
You gave a great presentation. You have a very clear idea of what it is. And I think I can also help you a lot. I'm one of those people who love gifts. I love giving gifts at the end of the year to my business partners and my team. And I love them to be meaningful gifts. So, I'm going to make you the offer for what you're asking for, for the percentage you're asking for. I don't want more. That's my offer. And I offer you my help as a Shark, help with my companies and everything I've already mentioned. Deal?

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Anyone else?

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
I'll go. I really loved your presentation. But I think it's a very competitive market. I've seen other projects doing something similar, and the project doesn't excite me as much as Amaury. So, for that reason, I'm out.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
Honestly, I fully agree with Amaury. I mean, as an entrepreneur, thumbs up. I love that you show them the packaging, for example. One of the big problems is that we go to any country in the world and buy a craft from that country, and they package it nicely. And here, they package it in...

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
In newspaper, yes.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
And then you haggle. And I loved that you touched on the topic of haggling. I don't have the commercial power that Amaury has, but we do have a platform where we want to export Mexican products, and I'd love for you to handle the handicrafts part. I'll make you an offer equal to Amaury's, and if Amaury wants me to join in, I'll join. If not, individually. I'm not going to haggle with you either.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
That's the wonderful thing about coming to the tank.

[Alejandro Litchi - Man]
Norma, you're doing very well. I see a problem that's important for you to solve. You said clients come to you on their own. I think it's time to get moving and go out to sell. So, what am I getting at? I think 250000 pesos seems too little for everything you want to do, marketing issues, standardizing your packaging. What I offer you is those 250000 pesos for what you're asking for, but I also offer you a loan of another 250000 pesos to really inject capital so you can achieve everything you're doing. I can help you a lot in the commercial area too. We could even develop something with artisans where we could include some items in my Nice catalog to reach more people, not just look for clients like companies, but also reach the general public.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Wow!

[Oso Trava - Man]
Definitely, having your own digital marketing arm, which is where I think you can reach many clients not only in Mexico but worldwide, will be key. I'm making the same offer they did for what you came to ask: 250 for 12.5%. And if you want to add me to any other offers, I'd be happy to collaborate with you. If not, that's okay too. Thank you. I love seeing this.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
I love seeing four offers from male Sharks to a female entrepreneur. How cool!

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Thank you very much.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
Who do you want to join in that you think will help your project? For me, it's important to know what interests you so we can see if it's worth teaming up or if I should go solo.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Okay.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
Deal?

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Well, in my ideal scenario, our ideal scenario at Ambiente Mexicano would be to have you, Lichi, and Amaury.

[Alejandro Litchi - Man]
Very good decision.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
That would be wonderful.

[Alejandro Litchi - Man]
Shall we go in together or what?

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
Let's do it, buddy.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
So, what you're accepting is 250000, if I understand correctly, divided between two, the 12.5% divided between two. And Lichi's loan, which goes no further. And Lichi's loan, if it's still on the table.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
If you need it, of course.

[Alejandro Litchi - Man]
So, do we have a deal?

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
We have a deal.
