Let me introduce myself: I'm Alan L. Rodríguez, the proud director and founder of Chahneke. Our sneakers are shoes powerfully crafted by artisan shoemakers in my beloved León, Guanajuato. The brand focuses on creating diverse products centered on creative diversity. We have a slogan: "Never give up," and we strive to reinforce each step in all our products. In the last five years, we have had sales of over 18 million pesos, with a net profit ranging from 35% to 65%. You might wonder why. Well, it's because we have two distribution areas. We have over 75 branches, including physical stores, entrepreneurs, and virtual outlets. And of course, our e-commerce site, chahneke.com, where we have reached unimaginable places: Australia, Taiwan, Taiwan, Europe, the United States, Mexico, and South America. Today, I am here to request 1.5 million pesos for 10% of our company.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
Can you tell us roughly how your sales are broken down?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Of course. In 2018, we sold 1.9 million pesos. Those aren't very strong numbers; however, I want to clarify that this was from our own distribution. In that year, we founded what are called Chahnekes Entrepreneurs, which are virtual branches in different areas of the country that we train, sort of incubate, so they can sell through networks with exclusive zones. In 2019, despite it being just a year later, we sold 2.6 million pesos. In 2020, which was the year of the pandemic, we were very afraid because many companies were going under. However, it was our boom. We sold 3.6 million pesos. In 2021, we went up to 4.9 million pesos. And in 2022, we reached 6.2 million pesos. Sharks, I wanted to bring each of you a gift.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
Those little ones, I think I know who they're for.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Yes, sir.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
Thank you very much, man. That's so cool. Thanks.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Oh, they're so cool. Thank you.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
Awesome. Thank you very much.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
Thank you very much. Are there exchanges and returns?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Of course. It's part of our warranty.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Wow, they're awesome.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
And you say you have, uh, physical stores? Branches? How many are there?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
They're not stores per se, fully branded as Chahneke, but rather by appointment. Something similar, where you have some products. You go by appointment, and if they have the product, they sell it to you; they have a terminal, or if not, you place your order and leave your deposit there.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Who accounts for your largest sales?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
65% through branches, as we mentioned, and 35% through my e-commerce.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
So, 65% is through these pop-up stores. You're not owners? You don't own any branches?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
No.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
Okay, I love that. And 35% through your e-commerce, which is 100% yours?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Yes.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
Do you only sell the Chahneke brand?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Yes.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
What's your average ticket?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Well, we vary between 990 to 1,499 pesos.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
And repeat purchases?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
I think around 60%.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Can I see your other models?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Of course.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
I have a problem with the valuation. You asked us for 1.5 million pesos for 10%. That's an implied valuation of 15 million pesos. That's more than two times sales. In a clothing or apparel business, the average is around 0.8 times sales. Would you be willing to revisit the valuation?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
I think we can reevaluate. There are things that may not be so tangible but are important, especially in this industry. We focus not only on creative innovation but also on quality. We offer size and quality guarantees. This means your product is guaranteed not only upon arrival but for life. If a product comes defective, we replace it or fix it.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
How often does that happen?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Very rarely; however, in 2022, we did have about 15% of such situations.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Alan, your numbers don't add up for me.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Okay.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
A 60% repeat purchase rate seems extremely high to me. They look durable. If that's true, then congratulations. But I don't believe it, okay? And a 15% return rate is also extremely high. So one doesn't match the other. Putting that aside, I didn't love your designs. I don't love the product. I think there's enormous competition in this market.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Enormous.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
And quality is super important. And I see some opportunities, areas for improvement, in quality, right? And for those reasons, I'm not going to make you an offer. I'm out.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Understood, thank you very much.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
I have two quick questions for you. Production capacity?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Right now, with 14 people, we're producing an average of 250 to 300 pairs per week.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
What inspires your designs?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
That's a great question. It ranges from wrestling, video games, anime, pop culture, even soccer or American football.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
So, you watch an American football game and say, "I liked those colors; let's make a design with those colors."

[Speaker 1 - Man]
The colors, the textures, even that lifestyle that comes from the players themselves.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
I love it. I think there's a product and a brand, but as I said, I don't like the valuation at all. At a valuation of five million, I would offer you a third of the amount, that is, 500,000 pesos, for 10%.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
So essentially, if we invested the entire amount, we'd get 30%.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
That's right.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
And for that offer, you need two sharks to join.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
That's right.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
One of the big problems in the footwear industry, where you are, is precisely that they don't design or do marketing; they produce and subcontract. But creating a brand is one of the big challenges the industry has. In that sense, I think what you're doing is very interesting. Now, there are production details. And I'm not sure, I just want to ask you how open you are to outsourcing manufacturing.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Yes, I would be open, as long as quality is perfectly audited, so that it doesn't detract from what we have but helps us improve.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
But I think what you're lacking is a bit of quality.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Yes.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
A little.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
There's always a lot to improve.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
I applaud entrepreneurs like you because I do believe there can be Mexican brands that are disruptive, that compete against industry giants. However, I'm a bit like Ale; I'm not crazy about the designs, and a consumer will compare you with all the brands in the market. So I'm not as passionate about a sneaker business. Rather, I think I could be a good customer of yours in the future, and for those reasons, I'm out. I wish you much success.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Thank you very much, Amaury.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Alan, I'm going to tell you two things that I think might help you, which helped me. I think it's important that you start recognizing your strengths and qualities and what you can delegate, that would be the first. The second mistake I made a lot was that I took many things for granted because I believed that's how things had to be done. There are many very reliable manufacturers, many who are super professional, and many brands that outsource manufacturing and make spectacular products. They care for and supervise, of course, whom they contract with. So, personally, with your production challenges and the fact that you had a 15% return rate, which is very high, you lost me at that point, and for that reason, I'm out.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Thank you very much.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'll offer you half the money at the same valuation as Karla.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
Ah!

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Well, now Karla has to decide if she's willing to put up the other half of the money and not just a third.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
Well, and you have to decide if you're interested in us coming in at that valuation, right? That is, for 30%.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
Exactly, exactly. 1.5 million for 30%, Marcus half and me half. Do we have a deal?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
We have a deal.
