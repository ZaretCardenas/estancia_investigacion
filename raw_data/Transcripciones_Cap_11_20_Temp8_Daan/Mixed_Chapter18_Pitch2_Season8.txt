Hello, sharks. He is José, and I am Rocío. We've all heard about the benefits that nopal cactus brings to our health, such as lowering cholesterol levels, helping prevent diabetes, aiding in controlling triglycerides, providing a lot of fiber, and being an excellent antioxidant.

[Speaker 2 - Man]
That's what we've come to present to you: Opania bread with fresh nopal. We've developed a process by which we take nopal and integrate it into flour, any type of flour. With that, we produce our bread. Each loaf of Opania bread contains 30% fresh nopal, which truly guarantees the benefits. Our process is pending patent approval, and our formula can be used in any bakery or facility equipped to produce bread. We are seeking 1750000 pesos for a 25% stake. This is our company's product. Who wants to help us improve Mexico's nutrition?

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Alright, let's prepare them.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
The gluttons.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
The gluttons.

[Brian Requarth - Man]
Ready, ready.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
Could you pass me one, please?

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
Please.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
I'll eat it just like that, on its own.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
What would you like with it?

[Brian Requarth - Man]
Serve it here. Ah.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Here you go. No, I was about to bring it to you.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
Thank you.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Well, let's see, I'll take this one. Do you want anything with it?

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
The consistency is the same.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
Prepare it however you like. If not, on its own is fine.

[Speaker 2 - Man]
This is the whole wheat version. Thank you. Then we developed the white bread version, which is a bit more accessible.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
More accessible in terms of price?

[Speaker 2 - Man]
Yes. We originally launched the whole wheat bread, we handle it frozen because it has no preservatives. Then we developed the white bread formula with a bit of preservative to handle it on dry shelves. It has a shelf life of 25 days, giving us more availability options.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
José, could you pass me one of the bread loaves so I can see the packaging? Thank you.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
This is the whole wheat version.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Is this the one we're tasting?

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Yes.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Okay. Currently, your sales consist only of selling the prepared bread. As a second plan, are you thinking of selling the flour, or are you already selling that mix?

[Speaker 2 - Man]
Right now, we only have the market for frozen whole wheat bread. The white bread, we received the packaging two or three months ago, is just about to enter another supermarket. But so far, with the sales we've had, we made around 400,000 pesos last year with just that, with the whole wheat bread. We estimate sales of one million to 1.2 million this year with just the whole wheat bread.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
What do you need the money for, José?

[Speaker 2 - Man]
The idea is to set up a small plant here in Mexico where we can produce 2,000 pieces daily, and another one adapted in Monterrey. With that money and having production, which will also help us have a better margin.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
Is the percentage of nopal due to cost, efficiency, profitability, or is it a formula issue? Can't you add more nopal?

[Speaker 2 - Man]
It's a formula issue, correct. We experimented until we got the right point, and that's what we arrived at.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
Is the valuation based on future sales or the company's assets?

[Speaker 2 - Man]
What we've invested is around three and a half million pesos. In the time we've been working on testing, having kitchens, developing the product, launching the brand, and conducting laboratory tests, around three and a half million is our estimate.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Also, last year we were only in one chain and faced quite a few setbacks.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
What is the product's shelf life?

[Speaker 2 - Man]
The white bread has a shelf life of 25 days on the shelf, and the whole wheat bread has three months frozen.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Frozen.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Seems like Brian is very quiet, isn't he?

[Brian Requarth - Man]
Yes. Look, the bread is very tasty. The bread is excellent. It has a good flavor. I love Mexico, and above all, I'm fascinated by Mexican food, it's incredible. After my time here, I could say I'm more Mexican than chili peppers, but less than nopal cactus. That's why I'm out.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Okay, okay.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
I loved the bread. What a great product. You've definitely gained a customer. But the reality is that besides the money, I couldn't contribute anything else. I don't know this industry. I know there are sharks with much more experience. So why get in the way? I'm out.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Thank you, Marcus.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Your branding is very nice, very clean. The attributes are well communicated. It's made with avocado oil.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Yes.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
That's another great advantage.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Yes.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
And the fact that it doesn't have any warning labels is wonderful. Working with flour, achieving that is profoundly difficult. Reaching this level is truly commendable.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Thank you.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
I like the attributes. I like that you've continued to innovate. But the valuation seems very high, and Alejandra and I are having doubts. What do you think, Alejandra?

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
The valuation is very high. Your current sales don't justify this valuation. But honestly, we really liked the product.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Yes.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
So we're going to offer you the 1,750,000 pesos you're asking for, but for 40% of the company, plus a royalty of five pesos per loaf of bread sold until we recover our investment. Once we recover our investment, we'll keep the 40%. And if you meet your projected goals, you can buy back 10% of the company at this same valuation, so we'd hold 30% and you 70%.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
Consistency in everything I say and do is very important to me. In this case, I speak a lot against wheat flour, and for that reason, I'm out, wishing you much success. If you manage to close the deal with Marisa and Ale, I'd be more than happy to help you in any way I can to improve your product and enhance people's nutrition.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Thank you, Amaury.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
Well, José, Rocío, what do you think of the offer?

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
I feel like they're going to turn us down, Marisa.

[Speaker 2 - Man]
We truly came here, we had seen your experience in this area and believe that you can help us a lot.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
So, do we have a deal?

[Speaker 2 - Man]
We have a deal with you.
