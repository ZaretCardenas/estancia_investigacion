[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Hello, Sharks, I'm Mónica Luna Y Parra, founder of Redtera and mother of two. I want to tell you the story of my son. When he was two years old, he was diagnosed with autism. It was one of the most difficult moments my husband and I have ever gone through. Studies have shown that one in six children need some type of therapy, be it motor skills, language, social skills, or learning. Applying this to Mexico, that's about 6.3 million children who would need some support. Ninety percent of brain connections occur during the first five years of life, so it's a critical time that we as parents must seize. I started creating a database. Desperate to find the best specialist, many parents would say to me, "Moni, help me, which one do you recommend? Which is the best here or there?" I became a reference point among family and friends, that's how Redtera was born. Redtera is a platform that brings together the best specialists for children and adolescents to make the search easier for parents and caregivers. Today, you can find categories on Redtera from pregnancy until you have a teenage child. It's like a hotel website where you go in, look at reviews, and choose what best suits what you're looking for. It's like a digital word of mouth. You can find categories ranging from lactation consultants, psychologists, speech therapists, to sensory integration therapists, there's everything. We make money from the registration of specialists. It's a premium membership that costs 250 pesos monthly, which includes advertising campaigns, the option for reviews, which is super important, and direct contact. We also have another membership, which is a free membership where only their profile appears. To date, we have helped more than 50 families. I want to take this nationwide because this is a need that must be addressed. I'm here to ask for 500000 pesos for 15% of my company. I want to tell you about my son, who is now five years old. He attends a regular school, and I don't know what would have become of him if we hadn't intervened in time with his therapies.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
How much have you sold? You say it costs 250 pesos monthly per therapist.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Yes.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Last year?

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
In 2021, we made 90000 pesos.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Uh-huh. And in 2022?

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
In 2022, we made 115000.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
What process do you use to include them in your network?

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
They register, and then it comes to my database. I check their professional license, and that's it.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
And these 500,000 pesos you're asking for, Moni, what are they for?

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
For a custom-made website.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
Mónica, according to my calculations, you have 40 registered therapists?

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Right now, I have 60 therapists, of which about 50 pay.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
If the therapists haven't wanted to pay you, say, half or 40%.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Yes, they want to join for free.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
Doesn't that indicate you might need to change your business model?

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Totally. And this is something that has opened up for me, and now, as a result of my preparation, we are having more contact with schools where they are sharing their databases because many schools send children to therapy.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
Mónica, tell me, how are you doing with foundations, organizations, NGOs? Have you made alliances?

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Not yet, Amaury, I swear. I'm open to it, and that's why I wanted to come here. This is something I've just started testing, and the little that comes in I've reinvested in advertising. But I'm open, and that's why I'm here. Anything helps.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
Mónica, the advertising you say you buy, is it targeted at professionals, therapists, or clients?

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
It's advertising directed at both.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Have you thought about charging the parents as well?

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
I'm open to it, yes, I'd like to, but right now with the little I have, I want parents to feel free. The last thing I want is to make it difficult for them. I want to say, "Here are these specialists; there's a filter of specialists."

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Mónica, I think that's where you need to change and modify what you're doing. Parents who need to find therapists might be much more willing to pay a reasonable fee to help them connect and find the right therapist because, in the end, you're solving a problem for them.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
I don't agree, Ale, because to me, this is a classifieds business. If I'm looking for an apartment, I'm going to the site that has the most listings in Mexico. I don't care if it's the prettiest or has the best filters; I care that it has the most offerings. So the first step you need to take is to capture, capture, capture as many therapists as possible.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Okay.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
And then, the person looking for an apartment never pays.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
But wait, they never pay?

[Karla Berman - Woman]
No.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
I think it's a two-sided marketplace. I need a service; you come to offer it to me, and on this platform, I can find it. I think you need to charge both sides.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
I think the ones who would be most willing to pay you, I agree with Ale, are the parents. And the mother, when you're desperate and they tell you, "I'll give you a site where for a fee, say, 300 pesos, 500 pesos", obviously, I do agree with Karla that the most important thing is that you need to have a huge directory of doctors.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
The problem with that, Marisa, is that it doesn't generate recurring sales. Suppose I pay you the 300 pesos. Once I know my therapist, I have no reason to pay you again. And most likely, in two years, I won't be looking for another specialist. So it's a very small-margin business.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
I still think you need to make alliances. I believe most people might not even be searching on the internet; they're looking in medical centers. That's where I think you need to have a powerful campaign, allies from other foundations, and even public or governmental health institutions in the country that help you be present and be that extra help to direct them to specialists, right?

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Thank you, Amaury.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Moni, I don't have much experience in this area. I own play centers. I'd love to collaborate happily with you if you find it useful, right? It's a utility, and if possible, we have many moms who come every day, which is what you need. I want to support you, really. But as an investor, I'm out.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Thanks, Ale.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Mónica, I was talking with Karla. Karla has great expertise in everything related to developing websites, marketing, or search engines. Any technological issue is her strength. Karla and I want to make you an offer. You would get two Sharks. The valuation seems high to us given the number of sales you've had up to today. So we offer you the same 500000 you're asking for. Karla would give you 250000; I would give you 250000. Karla for 15% and me for 15%. We would take 30%.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
I'm surprised by the generosity of Karla and Marisa in the offer they made you with the sales you have. I can't improve on it, and that's why I'm out.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Okay.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
Mónica, I agree with Marcus. They just made you a fantastic offer. I offer my connections through our foundation. If we can create synergy once you get a work plan going and are ready to reach out to me whenever you want, I offer my connections and my help. But as an investor, no. I'm out.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Thank you, Amaury. Thank you. Well, I want to say thank you very much for supporting this. Marisa, Karla. We have a deal.
