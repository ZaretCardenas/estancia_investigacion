[Speaker 1 - Male]
Hello, sharks. I'm Dani Saadia, and I'm here to ask for your help to recover from a mistake. I founded Dixo, which in 2005 was the first podcast network in Mexico and perhaps in the world. The fact is that we were doing so well that in 2021 an American company made me an offer I couldn't refuse. They paid fairly and more, hired my team under good conditions, and me as the director of podcasting, with a, truth be told, juicy salary. So you're probably wondering, what mistake is this guy talking about? Well, it so happens that a few months later, this American company was in turn bought by an even larger one, and they ignored my Dixo. But we held on like champs, and I negotiated my exit. They released me from my non-compete, we reached an agreement to recover Dixo, the brand, and the dot-com. I left money on the table, but I did it, like a legendary warrior. Dixo is ours again, and that's why I'm here. We want to be the powerhouse of Mexican intellectual property for the world. But for that, we need your money. So my offer is this: 5 million pesos plus 18 cents to produce at least five IPs. 5 million pesos plus 18 cents for 50% of all the profits generated by those IPs, plus 5% of Dixo, a company that billed over 40 million pesos between 2020 and 2021. Sharks, don't make the mistake of not closing this deal.

[Alejandra Ríos - Female]
I have a question. I don't know this industry well. What does it mean to be a powerhouse of Mexican intellectual property?

[Speaker 1 - Male]
The initial idea at this moment is to create five podcasts in different genres. One of horror, for example, two of fiction, one of true crime, which is also very trendy, and a documentary.

[Oso Trava - Male]
Dani, when I came in and saw Dixo, I thought, this sounds familiar. Obviously, it's something well-known in the podcast market in Mexico. In Mexico and Latin America, what's the business model? Where do the 40 million pesos that Dixo made in the last two years come from?

[Speaker 1 - Male]
Sales to platforms of stories, fiction, documentaries, true crime, I don't know, music.

[Oso Trava - Male]
But it's the transfer of the IP?

[Speaker 1 - Male]
Well, yes, I didn't keep the IP, and all the decisions to make a second season or continue with it don't depend on me. And that's one of the things that frustrates me a lot because I think we can build a whole universe. I mean, if we're going to release it, the idea is to release it ourselves and be able to control that IP.

[Alejandra Ríos - Female]
And how do you monetize these intellectual properties?

[Speaker 1 - Male]
It's extremely complicated. The idea is to invest one million pesos in an intellectual property, produce it, develop it, and once we've built that audience, we can license it to another language, for example.

[Marcus Dantus - Male]
Daniel, two qualitative questions.

[Speaker 1 - Male]
Yes.

[Marcus Dantus - Male]
I'd love to know, what's your area of expertise?

[Speaker 1 - Male]
A thousand percent in the creative part. I write, produce, direct. The problem with Dixo, to be honest, is that I do everything.

[Alejandro Litchi - Male]
I imagine what you're looking for from us is for us to help you with the entire operational part of the business.

[Speaker 1 - Male]
That would be fantastic, honestly.

[Oso Trava - Male]
Who is in charge of the commercial part?

[Speaker 1 - Male]
The person I currently have working at Dixo is dedicated 100% to seeking brands. We look for brands to create branded content for them, internal podcasts. I have an agreement with a company; they are dedicated to monetizing my podcasts, my entire network. It's a Swedish company, and they've already established themselves in Mexico. I made an agreement with them since they arrived in Mexico, and they pay me fifty percent of what they earn in programmatic. And if I secure the sponsorship, they give me seventy percent.

[Amaury Vergara - Male]
What concerns me a bit is starting specifically with projects, with five projects, right? It would be better when you say, well, let's start with one thing, and if it goes well, we'll build from there. It seems to me that, and correct me if I'm wrong, you were able to take the Dixo library with you. Do you have a good library, or are we at the stage of building a new content library?

[Speaker 1 - Male]
I have the library; yes, I recovered it. I recovered the entire library, and I even have some that are already quite advanced.

[Marcus Dantus - Male]
Dani, I'll tell you what I think.

[Speaker 1 - Male]
Yes.

[Marcus Dantus - Male]
I think you need to have much more confidence when you're selling something because I felt a hot-and-cold treatment, right? I mean, you started, got us excited with some potential, and then you said, but it's incredibly difficult to sell it. But I'll tell you where I think your mistake is, and I agree a lot with Amaury on this. If you had come to do one podcast and test it, I know, I mean, yes, I probably would have taken the risk. But coming for five at once seems to me to greatly increase the risk by not knowing where it's going to go, and that's why I'm out.

[Speaker 1 - Male]
Okay. Thank you.

[Amaury Vergara - Male]
Dani, let me tell you. The only problem I have is that it's a high ticket for a high valuation, and it's a high risk in something I don't know, right? It pains me as well; it hurts because I'd like to get involved with you. I like you as an entrepreneur; I like your phoenix story of rebirth. But unfortunately, I'm out.

[Speaker 1 - Male]
Thank you very much.

[Amaury Vergara - Male]
Now, if possible, I'd like to stay in touch with you and possibly explore a program, an IP that we can do together and see what happens.

[Speaker 1 - Male]
Thank you very much.

[Alejandro Litchi - Male]
It's great that you're truly committed to what you know how to do. I think you're lacking a lot in the commercial aspect because I believe that's the leg you're limping on. If I can help you in the future with some advice on the business side, the back end, not the technology part, I can support you in whatever you need. But unfortunately, for that reason, I'm out. But I really loved what you came to propose, the ideas that you're truly passionate about your dreams. And I know you're going to achieve them. I wish you the best of success.

[Speaker 1 - Male]
Thank you very much. Thank you.

[Alejandra Ríos - Female]
Dani, and why does a production cost one million pesos?

[Speaker 1 - Male]
It obviously involves talent. I mean, you need good actors, good scriptwriters. And the technical part of post-production, we already have that covered.

[Oso Trava - Male]
Dani, I'll tell you how I think about this. Let's see. Certainly, the podcast is becoming a great tool to test and develop intellectual property to sell later. It's not a game of secure income, not even secure, but not even predictable. The fact that so far it has been impossible to monetize the IPs you already have, that your commercial strategy to monetize your content depends on a third party, and that when creating content you're waiting to create and then have someone buy it, instead of listening to the market and perhaps generating branded content but not handing over the IP, like Hollywood movies do, I think there's a big opportunity. I think the challenge of monetization is there. And the one I've seen who has done it more successfully in Latin America is a company that started first with the commercial area and then with the creative area. And although it pains me deeply, that's why I'm out.

[Alejandra Ríos - Female]
The hardest thing is not creating the content, innovating, and making something that sells and is interesting and listened to by many people. The hardest thing is selling, monetizing. I see it as very risky how you're going to return our investment even with the 50% of profits you're promising us and the 5% of the company. So it's a lot of risk, and that's why I'm out, but I wish you much success.

[Speaker 1 - Male]
Thank you very much.

[Oso Trava - Male]
Dani, like Amaury said, count on me. I'll give you my phone number, and while you surely know much more than I do about podcasts, in whatever I can help you with, feel free.
