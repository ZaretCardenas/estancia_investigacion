Hello, sharks. Changing the world through water, that is our purpose. My name is Leandro, and together with my brother and partner Lucas, we created Pura 15 years ago. Today, there are more Wi-Fi connections than connections to quality water. Almost 100 percent of people do not trust the quality of the water they have. Lucas and I created Pura with the goal of changing the world through water and democratizing access to quality water. Pura is a Mexican company that manufactures the best water purifiers, water purifiers ready to connect, easy to use, and easy to maintain. To date, we already have 11 registered international patents and two specific to the European Union. Pura is a company with a triple positive impact: social, economic, and environmental.

[Speaker 2 - Man]
Currently, we are number one in water purifier sales. In the last three years, we have been selling twenty million pesos annually on average, with a profitability of thirty percent before taxes. We propose that you invest five million pesos for fifteen percent of our company.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
So essentially, it's a company selling water filters.

[Speaker 2 - Man]
Essentially, it's a company selling water purifiers. And since we are the third generation of water treatment professionals, we have the capacity to develop projects that generate positive impact, like our program "Connected by Water," in which, with the same technologies that we design and develop to purify water in homes, hotels, or restaurants, we reach communities that do not have access to water and provide them with that possibility to access water.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
And about how much does one cost? If you can reach communities, what's the price of one unit?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Our average ticket today is fifteen hundred pesos.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Fifteen hundred pesos, that's excellent.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
There are systems starting from eight hundred fifteen pesos, and that's also part of our differentiator, that we are not a magical single product. Instead, based on the water quality, we select which technology, which purifier is connected, and is appropriate for that case to obtain the water we want.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Tell me why and how Pura is different.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Pura is the only company in the Mexican market that has technology that removes arsenic from water. If you don't live in an area with an arsenic problem, it means three years free of maintenance, that is, when other brands in the category offer 3 months of performance and you have to change it every three to six months. At Pura, it's three years.

[Speaker 2 - Man]
The technological difference lies in the core proprietary technology of the patents that Leandro mentioned.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
How many types of products do you have?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
We have five purifiers, which use five different types of technology. These technologies scale according to whether it's for an industry or a home system.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
Most people are familiar with processes like osmosis, ultraviolet treatment, carbon filters, can you help us understand a bit about where your technology is headed?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Our technologies are composed of microfiltration, ultrafiltration, absorption, the one you mentioned, reverse osmosis, is an integral part of one of our systems, and then we pass it through a technology that will remineralize the water.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
A question, not medical.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Go ahead.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
How much did you sell in 2021?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
In 2021, we sold approximately 23 million pesos.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
And in 2022, last year?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Twenty-five million.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Okay, and how much do you expect to sell in 2023?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
We will be invoicing close to thirty million.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
Just one more number, what percentage of your sales is from e-commerce?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
About 50 percent.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
What are you looking for in a shark?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
We are looking for a shark who, first of all, shares our vision of the business model of generating social and environmental impact, and then the leverage we can gain from their business trajectory and knowledge of the channels.

[Speaker 2 - Man]
To beat bottled water that you can get anywhere, that's what we're aiming for.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Leandro and Lucas, you are incredible. I love what you're doing. I'm not the shark for you, so I'm out.

[Speaker 2 - Man]
Thank you, Ale.

[Brian Requarth - Man]
What's the plan with that money? Do you already know how you're going to invest it?

[Speaker 2 - Man]
Yes, we want to accelerate our business through marketplaces, our own e-commerce, and physical stores. Why do we need the money? For working capital and marketing.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
The valuation is fine in terms of sales; it's not great in terms of profits and growth, and obviously, my experience in the industry is zero. I share the vision without a doubt; that's why I'm out. But I participate in an impact investment fund in Latin America, and I think they'd be very interested in learning about your project. If you don't get an offer, we could talk afterward.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Okay, Marcus.

[Brian Requarth - Man]
I think, based on what you told me, that you need capital, working capital for the company, I don't know if you're interested in a loan of the money. It's around two hundred, I'm roughly calculating in dollars. If we set up a loan, it would be fixed in dollars; you would have to repay it in dollars with an interest rate of eight percent. You can pay me over the next three years, and after finishing paying off the loan, I would keep 5 percent of the company. Do we have a deal then?

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
I would recommend that you continue growing on your own, become more frugal, and focus a lot on your profits. To me, the percentage seemed low for a water filter, gross, before taxes, it seemed low. I congratulate you for having a purpose from the beginning, and I just advise you to think carefully about your decision. And since I don't have much to contribute to you, for that reason, I'm out.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
Leandro, Lucas, entrepreneurs like you put me in a difficult position because I really like you; we also have things in common, and obviously, I'm very committed to changing the world and dream of the day when we can eliminate PET bottles. However, I see a high valuation, low profitability, a distant return on investment, and an industry that I frankly don't know. With much regret, I'm going to have to step aside, so I'm out.

[Brian Requarth - Man]
So, do we have a deal?

[Speaker 2 - Man]
No, no, before that, we wanted to know, as we told you, we are looking for partners to grow exponentially here in Mexico and then expand to the United States. I wanted to know if, besides the loan, you could contribute something more.

[Brian Requarth - Man]
Well, honestly, I see myself more as a financial partner, to be sincere. One thing I always practice with entrepreneurs is being super authentic. If you're looking for someone strategic in that business who will sit down with you and direct an execution plan, I'm probably not the right person. I understand that you're looking for someone to be there with you, swimming alongside you. So in this case, I'm out. I think you'll find other paths, and well, onward, right?
