Hello, how are you, sharks? I'm Yubusen, and this is my partner, Iván Lozano. Our company, AI Lab School, is an educational program that trains Mexican programmers in the development of artificial intelligence. We accompany the student in three stages. The first is training, where we teach them artificial intelligence. We move on to the second stage, which is portfolio development, where students have the opportunity to work on internal school projects and projects from partner companies. The last stage is talent placement, where we help our students secure jobs in tech companies both in Mexico and the United States. The three stages have a duration of nine months, the price of the program is 24000 pesos, and we provide scholarships through a socioeconomic study. From 2021 to date, we have 150 enrolled students; we have increased year after year by 300%. Additionally, we have two lines of business: the first is software development in artificial intelligence, and the second is technological talent recruitment. From mid-2021 to the end of 2022, we have generated a total of 1063000 pesos in sales with a net margin of 40%.

[Speaker 2 - Male]
What makes us different is that we specialize only in artificial intelligence, so that allows us to be at the forefront of everything new in this area. We have technology developed with artificial intelligence, by the way, that allows us to have a database of 400000 companies between Mexico and the United States that focus on technology. We have web scrapers that are collecting job postings, and we provide this tool to our students so they can search for jobs when they finish. This allows them to have access to thousands of positions immediately, in five seconds. We want to make this very accessible; we would like to reach a point where the cost of our program could be 1,600 pesos.

[Speaker 2 - Male]
Companies that do not use AI in the next five years are like those without the internet. We are seeking 700,000 pesos for 10% of our company, and we add its equivalent in investment in scholarships for Mexican programmer students.

[Alejandra Ríos - Female]
What a great offer, guys!

[Marisa Lazo - Female]
Yes, a very good offer.

[Speaker 1 - Male]
Thank you.

[Marisa Lazo - Female]
In those nine months, is there a part that's in-person and another part online? Is everything online? That would be my first question. And the second is, do they need any preparation?

[Speaker 1 - Male]
The program is 100% online; it makes it super flexible.

[Speaker 2 - Male]
The requirements currently are that you need to have a technological background. If you don't have it, we have a pre-course where we teach you programming. Part of the investment we want is to reach another sector, which includes entrepreneurs, program managers, product managers. So part of the investment we want is to diversify a bit more to non-technical people.

[Amaury Vergara - Male]
How many graduates have you managed to place in companies?

[Speaker 2 - Male]
100%.

[Amaury Vergara - Male]
Okay.

[Speaker 2 - Male]
Currently, companies in Mexico, 67% have problems finding talent. And in the United States, there are over 800000 positions that remain vacant annually in terms of technology. So our students are in high demand.

[Brian Requarth - Male]
Speaking about your business model, there's a part where they pay to be in the program, that's one income stream you have. Portfolio development, so you execute projects for other companies. And third, with a big company from Silicon Valley, you receive remuneration for that work. So you can monetize this talent that is paying you by doing projects for other companies.

[Speaker 2 - Male]
Exactly.

[Brian Requarth - Male]
And then you earn for the third time when they enter that next job, correct? So there are three different business models. And what is the future projection of those three business models?

[Speaker 1 - Male]
What we are doing is building a talent pool. We want to use this talent pool to develop projects, software, and artificial intelligence, from where the majority of our projected future income will come. And in that way, reduce the cost of our program to a symbolic 1600 pesos.

[Alejandra Ríos - Female]
And right now, your revenues in 2022, how were they divided among these three lines of business?

[Speaker 1 - Male]
In 2022, it was 859000 pesos. Forty five percent comes from the students, 35% from software development, and 20% from recruitment.

[Brian Requarth - Male]
I think it's a growing market. I believe I have two potential conflicts of interest. So I would like to perhaps hire people you have because portfolios need more talent. But I'm out because I think it enters into a conflict.

[Speaker 1 - Male]
Thank you. Thank you very much. Another thing is that we also want to diversify our product, and we're going to create a course, a training for non-technical people. Because they also need it, they need to learn the basics and be able to connect with programmers so they can communicate at the same level.

[Alejandra Ríos - Female]
I am an advisor to the largest private university group in Mexico. And I think this is something that will interest them greatly to form an alliance for a training program after completing their postgraduate studies or while they're still at university. For that reason, I want to be part of this with you. And I'm going to make you an offer: the 700000 pesos you're asking for, but I want 20% of the company.

[Speaker 1 - Male]
Thank you very much.

[Marcus Dantus - Male]
I love the focus. I think that focus has a lot of future. I believe I have the contacts to start generating not only promotion in various entities in Mexico but probably even state scholarships that pay a part of the tuition, which are programs currently running in several states. And I offer you 700,000 pesos for 15% of the company.

[Speaker 1 - Male]
Thank you very much. Thanks.

[Marisa Lazo - Female]
Hugo and Iván, I deeply agree that this is what our country needs most, this type of education and preparation. So I applaud all of that. I think these two sharks are better options for you than me; they can contribute more exactly in what you are looking for. And for that reason, I'm out.

[Speaker 1 - Male]
Thank you very much. Thanks.

[Amaury Vergara - Male]
For me, artificial intelligence is like a drop of blood in the sea for a shark, meaning, I know it's the future. For me, it's the future of humanity. I think it will take us to a level that we don't even fully understand yet. It's already happening, and it excites me greatly. However, I don't necessarily see myself as a partner in this company. Rather, I see myself as a good client, and I prefer to say it plainly. I would like to stay in touch with you, and for those reasons, I'm out.

[Speaker 1 - Male]
Thank you, Amaury. And thank you for the offers. Could you give us a few minutes to discuss it? Thanks. Guess what? We want both of you.

[Others]
Ah.

[Speaker 1 - Male]
And we are willing to lower our valuation to Alejandra's, to 700000 pesos for 20%, to also have you, Marcus, with a repurchase option in the next two years at a multiple of 200% of today's valuation.

[Brian Requarth - Male]
So you lower to Ale's valuation but want to be able to repurchase the 10%? The 10% at twice the value you are currently paying, in the next two years, correct?

[Speaker 1 - Male]
Yes. And we are also open to, if you connect us with companies that want to develop artificial intelligence, we can give you a five-year vesting based on performance or sales achievement.

[Marcus Dantus - Male]
All right. We have a deal.
