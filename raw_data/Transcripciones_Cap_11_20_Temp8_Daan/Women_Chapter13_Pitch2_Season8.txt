Hello, sharks. I'm Pamela Garduño, founder of Swimsey, a sports marketer, industrial designer, and former swimmer. At Swimsey, we offer swimsuits made in Mexico with social and environmental consciousness. We provide designs with vibrant prints in versatile models that adapt to diverse body types, and we use fabrics made from recycled plastics with high chlorine resistance. A Swimsey swimsuit lasts eight times longer than a regular one. We have grown the brand moderately by reinvesting profits. In 2022, we nearly reached 4,000 pieces sold, surpassed 2 million pesos in sales, which meant a 40% growth compared to 2021. We are at an upward moment, and that's why I'm here. I'm asking for 400000 pesos in exchange for 15% of my company. Sharks, who wants to swim on my team? I would love for you to come closer to evaluate our suits.

[Alejandro Litchi - Male]
Let's see them. I'm a professional swimmer. Do you have more for women or also for men?

[Speaker 1 - Female]
We have both models. For men, we have jammer and brief, which are shorts and briefs, and for women, we have one-piece and bikini. The bikini is also 100% sporty and body-fitting. Let me bring some over so you can see them.

[Marcus Dantus - Male]
Pamela, while they examine the suits.

[Speaker 1 - Female]
Yes, of course.

[Marcus Dantus - Male]
You talked about sales in 22 versus 21.

[Alejandro Litchi - Male]
Don't look, touch here.

[Alejandra Ríos - Female]
Oh, thank you.

[Speaker 1 - Female]
In '22, it was 2,100,000; in '21, it was 1,600,000.

[Alejandra Ríos - Female]
So, are these made with recycled materials?

[Speaker 1 - Female]
Half of the fibers are recycled polyesters made from bottles, fishing nets, and other types of waste plastics. The other half is a polyester called PBT, which gives it high durability.

[Marcus Dantus - Male]
Pamela, aside from the social aspect, why do they prefer them? Because of the fabric? Because it's more durable? Because it fits better?

[Speaker 1 - Female]
Firstly, because of the designs. Traditional swimsuits are black, navy blue, with very traditional lines, wide straps, very classic. I'm proposing adjustable backs, double straps styles that aren't seen as much. The prints are very innovative in swimming. And the price, we are 30-40% less than the big international brands.

[Adriana Gallardo - Female]
How much does it cost to make a suit?

[Speaker 1 - Female]
How much does it cost to make a suit? For example, the full swimsuit costs 400-450 pesos to make, and we are selling it at 860.

[Alejandra Ríos - Female]
So you have a margin of 50%.

[Speaker 1 - Female]
Gross margin on average is 55%.

[Alejandro Litchi - Male]
Is that price to your distributors or the retail price?

[Speaker 1 - Female]
The price I gave is the retail price.

[Alejandro Litchi - Male]
Retail price?

[Speaker 1 - Female]
We have a scale, they can earn from 12% up to approximately 25%, depending on the amount of...

[Alejandro Litchi - Male]
Depends on the sales volume.

[Speaker 1 - Female]
Purchase volume.

[Alejandro Litchi - Male]
How big is the market? How many swimmers? There are associations of swimmers. Do you know that number?

[Speaker 1 - Female]
Yes. Well, associations are a reduced number because not everyone affiliates.

[Alejandro Litchi - Male]
Not everyone competes, but of swimmers who do...

[Speaker 1 - Female]
I have focused a lot on ages 15 to 59, the active population from 15 to 59 years old in Mexico is 25 million people. Of those 25 million people, 7% practice swimming, which is the fourth most practiced sport in Mexico.

[Adriana Gallardo - Female]
What's the biggest risk you have that could make you fail?

[Speaker 1 - Female]
I think the risk would be not being able to position myself or grow to where I want to reach, which are these specialized stores, attending more events. My dream is even to expand out of Mexico into Latin America, where they are experiencing a very similar situation with swimsuits. And well, someday, the world.

[Adriana Gallardo - Female]
Pamela, I see that this is a very niche business, and above all, you need to have a strong and significant presence in digital marketing. And for that, you need a lot of money. I really don't think I'm the person who can help you consolidate your dream. For that reason, I'm out.

[Speaker 1 - Female]
Thank you very much, Adriana.

[Amaury Vergara - Male]
Pamela, I want to share where I stand.

[Speaker 1 - Female]
Okay.

[Amaury Vergara - Male]
It seems to me that you haven't knocked on enough doors. I think you should insist there. Just insisting will give you a lot of information that will help you design a better product. And what I think you need is that breakthrough point, right? That moment when a brand, or rather, a big chain—can say, "I'm interested in your product, and I'm going to distribute it in many stores." I feel that's where you have to aim. Because if not, your growth can be very slow and frustrating, and it can cost you more time and money than you're perhaps seeing right now. And I think you have to aim for that. I don't think I'm the shark who can help you particularly with this because I think it's very specific. Therefore, I'm out. But I wish you much success.

[Speaker 1 - Female]
Thank you very much, Amaury. Thanks for your advice.

[Amaury Vergara - Male]
You're very welcome.

[Marcus Dantus - Male]
You know, the focus doesn't bother me. Although I do think and agree that the market is very small. What worries me the most is that to find a distributor, as Amaury says, or someone who distributes for you on a large scale, your margins are very small, and the potential profit for whoever distributes is low. I mean, you mentioned from 12% to 25%. I'm definitely not a retail person who can get you into stores. But let me open a little window for you into the future.

[Speaker 1 - Female]
Okay.

[Marcus Dantus - Male]
We have an e-commerce platform for the market, for Mexican entrepreneurs. I think we could help you make your brand known there. And we could revisit this in the future. But for now, I'm out.

[Speaker 1 - Female]
Thank you very much, Marcus, and for the offer, the opportunity.

[Alejandra Ríos - Female]
I see your biggest risk, Pamela, in competition. In many cases, being a 100% Mexican brand made with sustainable materials is very positive, it will appeal to the public. That differentiation to get them to buy from you versus the competition. In this case, I feel your differentiators are not big enough for them to choose you over the competition. And for that reason, I'm out.

[Speaker 1 - Female]
Thank you very much, Ale.

[Alejandro Litchi - Male]
I loved you as an entrepreneur. It's clear you've put incredible passion into everything you've done. They are beautiful, but I think you can do something even better if you get good advice from a good designer. What scares me are the margins; that's why I'm out. But I do want to help you, give you advice and see how we can assist you, both in marketing matters and in ways to incentivize your distributors so they can sell more. There are various ways to do many things that can help you.
