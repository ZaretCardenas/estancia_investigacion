[Speaker 1 - Man]
Hello, sharks. I'm Roby Peña Castro.

[Speaker 2 - Man]
And I'm David Villa.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Today, we want to introduce you to Leadsales, a conversational commerce platform for small and medium-sized businesses in Latin America. Imagine losing a sale of more than half a million pesos because you didn't follow up on a conversation in messaging apps and social networks. This happened to us and to millions of companies throughout Latin America. That's why we created Leadsales. Leadsales helps you organize conversations into columns for follow-up, add notes, and schedule follow-up messages to close sales for your company.

[Speaker 2 - Man]
We are proud to have more than 1,200 clients in over 20 countries, mainly in Mexico, Colombia, and Peru. Leadsales was born in 2020, and there we managed to sell one million pesos. In 2021, we scaled our sales to 8 million pesos. By 2022, we closed the year selling 18 million pesos. For the last month of 2023, we project to sell 16 million pesos that month. As of today, we have investors in the United States, Latin America, and Europe. That's why we want to invite you today, sharks, to invest 2 million pesos for 1% of our company. We have feedback from our clients that in the first three months of using Leadsales, they triple their sales.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
There are several platforms like this on the market. You have good traction; we're doing well, but you're not the only platform that does this. Tell us what your differentiator is.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Our key differentiator is this column-based funnel visibility. No other competitor has this. Why? Because all other competitors focus on presenting you with an inbox or a list of omnichannel, multi-agent messages, and we have this view where you can drag conversations. And not only that, we have a very competitive price. We have an offer of $7 for 7 days, and we also charge $83.99 per month.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
Do you charge monthly per company or per user?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
We charge $83.99 per company.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
Regardless of the number of users?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
For three users, and we charge an extra $10 per additional user. Our value proposition is that we triple your sales in the first three months, and practically the service pays for itself.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
Please tell me about your shareholder structure and your startup model.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
So far, we have raised a pre-seed round since we started bootstrapped, that is, with our own savings. And thanks to the pricing model that has worked for us since day one, we were able to leverage our own sales.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
Now, how much was this pre-seed round?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
We raised $400000 at a valuation of $8 million with investors from the United States and angel groups in Latin America.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
How many partners are there?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
It's just the two of us.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
You two, plus the funds.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
And investor funds. It's also important to mention that last year we entered an accelerator in Silicon Valley that likewise invested $200000 for 7.5% of our company.

[Brian Requarth - Man]
One question, and I'm going to be a bit abrupt here because I think the elephant in the room is that you're selling 1% of the company. Did you come to seek partners or exposure?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
We are really here to seek partners. We believe that each of you has companies that can use our service and have access.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
So you're here to look for clients.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
We're here to look for partners because at the end of the day, if you invest with us, you're not only investing in a technology company; you're investing in the first 100% Mexican company that has brought out pure innovation.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
But what Brian is getting at is, for 1% of the business, how motivated are we going to be to really roll up our sleeves and get to work with you?

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
Gentlemen, gentlemen, let me say something very quickly. For me, 1% doesn't make me feel like you really want me. I'm out.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
I want to make you an offer.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Thank you. Thank you.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
I am interested, but I would participate if you accept the valuation you gave to the Silicon Valley investor. For $200000, that is, 4 million pesos, they got 7.5%. You are asking us for 2 million for 1%. For those 2 million pesos, which are $100000, you give me 3.75%, and I have an offer for you.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
We are grateful. Thank you.

[Brian Requarth - Man]
You know we're in 2023, right? Because when I look at that valuation, it makes me think you're still in 2021. In fact, the bubble burst. I imagine you're not profitable.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
As of today, we're burning around $25000 a month.

[Brian Requarth - Man]
You were profitable, and now you're investing in growth.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Yes, in the growth of our product because the challenges we have are more technological, how to scale the more than 70 million messages we process per month.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
I understand the need for capital. What I don't agree with is the valuation and the fact that you believe you're the only company doing this in Mexico. You're not. I use one of these solutions in my company. You need to evaluate the market well and understand what your differentiator is because organizing conversations in a sales funnel is not enough. I think you've sold well; you're great entrepreneurs in this industry, which is so difficult.

But you haven't convinced me, and I'm out.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Thank you.

[Brian Requarth - Man]
I have a company that can definitely use your product. In fact, I urgently need this. I would join Marisa's offer, and I'll tell you the structure I have in mind: you give us 1% each, plus 1% as advisors or board members each. That's the offer.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Sounds good to me.

[Brian Requarth - Man]
So, I'm going to row these seas alone here. I'm going to swim alone in this. So, I have an offer for you: 2.5 million pesos for 4%. No equity because I don't have to prove what I've done. I think you should know it and hope you recognize it.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Do you have an answer?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
We have a counterproposal. We would love for all of you to be involved, and we would like to put on the table that all of you invest 10 million pesos for 5%.

[Brian Requarth - Man]
It seems you didn't come to make a deal, to be honest. And well, if you want a partner, we're really here. We're willing to get into this. But at that valuation, it doesn't make sense to me.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Okay.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
So, you came without room to negotiate.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
We want to negotiate, and if any of you propose 10 million pesos for 5%.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
That's the same valuation; you're not negotiating.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
No.

[Brian Requarth - Man]
Honestly, it seems to me that you came here for the lights, the cameras, and you're not looking for a real partner.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
I think it's okay to reject our offers; you have every right to do so. And with what you're proposing, I'm out.

[Brian Requarth - Man]
Well, let's do it: one for 1.5%, but I would like to have some advisory shares in addition to that.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
How many advisory shares do you want?

[Brian Requarth - Man]
Post-money, 2%.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
To have 1.5%.

[Brian Requarth - Man]
1.5% with the money invested, and I want 2% advisory shares with two years of vesting.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
So, you would end up with 3.5% in the end.

[Brian Requarth - Man]
We can make it more equivalent: 1.5%, 1.5%. Final offer; if you don't like it, well, good luck.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
I think it's a good offer. I can't match it, nor do I want to match it. I'm out. But we'll do business, for sure.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
We'll talk, of course.

[Brian Requarth - Man]
And you know what? When we go to Brazil, I'll include you in the biggest event there, three thousand five hundred companies, startups. And I'll get into business with you to ensure that, at least, we have the chance to get funding from the big ones. Do we have a deal?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
We have a deal, Brian.
