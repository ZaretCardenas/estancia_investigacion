Hello, sharks. This is Juan José Lecanda, and I am Rodrigo Serrano. We are the creators of Tomasa. Did you know that in Mexico, a person consumes 33.5 kilograms of bread per year, of which 30% is sweet bread, and the favorite item is the concha? I teamed up with Juan José and Daniela, my partners and now my best friends, and we created a Mexican concept exclusive to conchas. We wanted to honor the Mexican baker by referencing when our ancestors would go out to sell bread with a basket on their heads. We focus on primarily artisanal ingredients, which are in the topping and also inside the dough. We don't just have sweet tomasas but also savory ones. We have a "rosca" focused solely on conchas with different Mexican flavors. And we also have our flagship product, which are miniature conchas, I see that Ale is already trying them. Perfect.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
That's right, Ale.

[Speaker 2 - Man]
In 2020, we sold 3.4 million pesos, with a profit margin of 36%. In 2021, 3.7 million pesos, with a profit margin of 16%. And in 2022, 4.4 million pesos, with a profit margin of 23%. Today, what we are asking from you is one million pesos for 15% equity. You have two different products: the "tomasitas," which are what's in the cup, and the pink boxes contain medium-sized conchas. They come in five different flavors, and there you can try some of the range we have.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Your profits decreased significantly from 2020 to 2021.

[Speaker 2 - Man]
That's correct.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
What explanation do you have?

[Speaker 2 - Man]
There are many explanations. The main one is that in June 2021, we opened our second location in Polanco. When we opened Polanco, due to a lack of operational control, that's the reality, the purchasing manager started making wholesale purchases as if we had exorbitant sales, which we didn't. And the second problem was that the entire economy started to reactivate. All the businesses around both our locations reopened, and obviously, that led to us having more input purchases, less sales, and that completely consumed us.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
It catches my attention that with two locations in 2021, you only increased sales by 10%.

[Speaker 2 - Man]
Yes, a big part is precisely due to what I was explaining.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
But Ale is right that even in 2022, they sold 4.4 million, which is only one million more than in 2020 with two locations.

[Speaker 2 - Man]
We had a 7% increase from 21 to 22. Polanco worked very well; Condesa stagnated.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
How much does each location sell?

[Speaker 2 - Man]
In 2022, out of the 4.4 million pesos, Polanco sold 2.3 million, and Condesa sold 2.1 million.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
But that's a 30% decrease.

[Speaker 2 - Man]
Yes.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
It's a total crisis.

[Speaker 2 - Man]
Yes, correct, a total crisis.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
How are you going to bring it back up to 3 million?

[Speaker 2 - Man]
Right now, what we're trying to do is turn things around with the support of Polanco, and we want to open more points of sale to be able to turn this around.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
A plain concha, classic, what is its price, and how much more expensive is it compared to a traditional concha in a bakery of any brand?

[Speaker 2 - Man]
37 pesos and 48 pesos.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Wow.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
Hey, Juan José, Rodrigo, the truth is that I really liked both of you.

[Speaker 2 - Man]
Thank you, Marcus.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
And I'm trying to see how I can offer you something, but I'm not going to help you at all. With all due respect, I'm out. But I'd be happy to help you in any way I can.

[Speaker 2 - Man]
We appreciate it very much.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
Hey, I was fascinated by the brand, from the boxes, the logo, the illustration. I think it's a brand that has mystique, and I love it. Like Marcus, I don't know anything about the food business. The only thing I know is what they taught me in business school: the most important metric for a food chain is same-store growth. And since it's the only metric by which I can judge you, at this time, I'm out. But I would love to follow you closely and advise you on any marketing-related issues.

[Speaker 2 - Man]
Thank you very much, Karla.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
Juan José, Rodrigo.

[Speaker 2 - Man]
Yes.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
First, let me say that I really like your brand.

[Speaker 2 - Man]
Thank you.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
I would love to be able to tell you, "Hey, I'm the right shark because I can show you a lot about how we can expand this." But I think you have other sharks in this tank who have more expertise than I do. I think I prefer to step aside. I'm out, but I wish you much success.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Thank you, Amaury.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Marisa, what are you going to do?

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Well, oh dear!

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Look, I'm worried about something. In the end, you're a gourmet bakery.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Yes.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
That focuses on a single product. But I really like your product. So, what are we going to do?

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
Go ahead.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
I would love to be part of Tomasa, but only if Marisa joins me. And the offer is one million pesos for 25% of the company.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Juan José and Rodrigo. I see a big risk or difficulty for growth: the price. It's a very niche product, paying 36 and 47 pesos for a concha. It's a business that works very well for you, but since it's not so scalable, I think it's not a business where Ale and I would do so well as investors. I see it as very good for you. We'd be happy to advise you, delighted. Ale and I love it. I just don't feel it's a business that's so scalable and that would go well for all of us together. Therefore, I'm out.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
So we're out.
