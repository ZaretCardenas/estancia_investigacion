[Speaker 1 - Man]
Hello, sharks. What started as a simple hobby of a chubby guy has become my passion, and today I've turned it into a business. I'm Ricardo Sabio, but you can call me Rich, and I'm the creator of Richeese, the first fondue to go in Mexico that's taken the city by surprise and gone viral, reaching over 10 million people. With the intention of promoting cheese culture in Mexico and continuing to boost the country's gastronomy in a practical and fun way, I developed Richeese. Would you like to try it?

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Yes, please.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
Absolutely!

[Speaker 1 - Man]
This is Mari and Santi. They're part of the Richeese Dream Team and will be assisting us. But I could use another hand.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Me!

[Speaker 1 - Man]
That's it, my Ale. Let me tell you a bit about what we do. We take a sourdough baguette and fill it with a mixture of cheeses.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
What a great idea!

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
No way!

[Speaker 1 - Man]
A mix of the finest artisanal cheeses. You can add Italian sausage, prosciutto, or mac and cheese. Try the fries.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Who wants just cheese?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
I think that would be Karlita.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
What, just bite into it like this?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Yes, yes! Smother it in cheese. It's hot, be careful.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Let me see, if you want, I'll make them for you. How do you do it?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Put a bit of cheese, then the sausage, and just look at that.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Wow! Look at that!

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
That one, for example, is like a brushstroke of cheese.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Yes, this one is just that. It's cheese first, then sausage, and then more cheese.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Amaury, tell me you wouldn't love to try this while watching your Chivas win.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
I'll have just cheese too.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Don't you want some of this?

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
I want to try the cheese one. Is it delicious?

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Which one is the best? Can you pass me a little bread, please? Can I make one with whatever I want?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
However you like, my Ale.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
So, can I add fries to it?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Let me help you, and I'll make these fries for you.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Awesome! I'm a big fan of French fries.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
The idea is that it's so practical you can take it anywhere.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Oh, look, is that right?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
It's to-go, yes. So you can eat it in the park.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Super practical. Did you see how it closes? A demonstration. You carry it like this. It's fantastic.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
I'm taking the fries.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Alejandra doesn't miss out, does she?

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
So, what did they put on the fries? Cheese?

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Cheese.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Did you like it?

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Delicious.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Marisa can't even talk.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
This is the most effective tank strategy, let me tell you, Rich.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Well, I have a surprise for you because the cheeses aren't the best part, it's my numbers.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
That's what I'm talking about! Let's hear them!

[Speaker 1 - Man]
With just one location of less than 20 square meters located in La Condesa, at Parque España, in six months of operation we've managed to sell almost 10 million pesos with a profit margin of 35%. I believe this business is highly scalable, and I want to take it everywhere. I know you can help me with that. That's why I'm looking for a shark to help me exponentially grow my business, and I'm willing to offer 10% for 1.5 million pesos.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Where are these cheeses from, Ricardo?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
The cheeses are a mix of different kinds. Currently, a small percentage are signature cheeses I'm producing from cow's milk. Since my current sales level doesn't allow me to supply myself completely, I'm importing cheeses from France, like French raclette, Emmental from the valleys of Switzerland, and artisanal Dutch Maasdam.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
How much does a simple baguette with just cheese cost?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
The one with just cheese starts at 185 pesos.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Okay.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
And the most expensive one, let's say?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
220 pesos, which includes prosciutto or Italian sausage.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
What's your ownership structure?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
I'm currently the sole owner.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
Very good.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
And before this, what did you do? Tell us a bit about yourself.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
I've had a career in the wine and spirits industry for about six years. My cousins, uncle, and I started a cheese brand, and that's where my passion for cheese began. With all this experience, I thought about creating something practical and easy that would continue promoting cheese culture in Mexico. So I developed Richeese, a practical, fun, and easy way to enjoy fondue anywhere.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
It's a different concept.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
The concept is that we have a few tables, but it's really about coming in, enjoying it, and then you're on your way.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
And you can walk around with it.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
It's a product with an integrated concept, starting from marketing. Every time someone gets it, they want to take pictures. That's also why I've gone viral on social media. I see it everywhere. You can set it up very simply at a stand or event. The operational model, the business model, is super replicable while maintaining the essence of quality ingredients and craftsmanship. The challenge is finding enough staff to bring this to various events.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Hey, Rich, Rich, it smells like cheese and offers are in the air because the sharks seem interested.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Alright, here we go.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
Give me a second. Well, go ahead, go ahead.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Do you want to go first?

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
Yes, yes.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Are you sure?

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
Go ahead.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Okay.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
I think there's something here no one is considering. You're free to make your offer, but in this type of business, Marisa, you know that the most important medium-term metrics are growth in new locations and same-store sales. I'm concerned about those two factors because they're important for future planning. As a customer, you've got me, I'll be there every month, but for that reason, I'm out.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Thank you very much.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Look, there are several things I like about your project. One, keeping it simple. Simple operations with few ingredients and dishes are the easiest to replicate, I agree with you. I would focus more on brick-and-mortar locations than events. For events, you'd need staff specifically for that, and when there are no events, they'd need other tasks. A permanent location is better to start with, and you can consider events later. For all these reasons, we want to make you an offer, Marcus, Alejandra, and I, so you can have three sharks who are specialists in different areas.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
The dream team.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
The dream team of Alejandra, Marcus, and me. We'll offer what you're asking for and the percentage you requested.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
For 10%?

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
And I'd like to add one more thing.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Okay.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
It's very important that we like the entrepreneurs we invest in.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Of course.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
It seems like we'd work great with you.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Thank you very much.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
I don't like decimals, remember, Marcus.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Alright, so for 12%, that way, it's 4% each, but for the amount you're asking for.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
We respect your valuation. Honestly, I want you all on board. With three sharks, I know you can contribute a lot and help take Richeese to where I envision it. Then I can become a shark like you.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
That's the spirit!

[Speaker 1 - Man]
But considering everything we've discussed, perhaps 12% isn't enough for you or attractive enough to get you involved. I'm willing to maintain my valuation but offer up to 20% so you can be fully involved and I can have more capital.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
The only problem, Rich, is that Ale doesn't like decimals.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
So it has to be 21%. Seven each, 7, 14, 21.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
I think you have a fantastic offer. What you're saying is very valid, you want us to have more percentage in the company. And we also would like a bit more equity. So we could offer you 21%, meaning 7% each.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Seven, seven, seven.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
But we will lower the valuation slightly.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Just a little.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Three million pesos for 21% of your company. I have to tell you, that matches the offer you made.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Yes, yes. That's why I'm keeping it the same; I just want you more involved.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
I like it.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
I want you to help me with that.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
So, do we have a deal or not?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Well, Amaury is giving me a look...

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
You're giving me a look, too.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Well, Amaury?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Do you have an offer?

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
Look, I'm going to help you out by not competing with the other sharks. I see your eyes lit up with them. I'm out, and I wish you much success.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Thank you very much.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
So, do we have a deal?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
We have a deal.
