Hello, sharks. My name is Omar González. We are aware of the significant problem of water scarcity and waste. I've always had the desire to create a product that is environmentally friendly. I'm an inventor; inventing and modifying products for optimal functionality comes naturally to me. I have invented an odor trap. Once this odor trap is installed permanently in urinals, it makes them water-free. I'm offering 15% equity for one million pesos.

This is the system that needs to be replaced in current ecological urinals. This is the system I invented.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Wait, let me see. How does it work?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Okay, when liquids come through the grate, by overflow...

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Ah, I see.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
The cylinder tilts. So, imagine this part is sealed. When bad odors try to come up, they can't exit here because it's sealed, nor here because it's also sealed. So the odor trap is this.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Okay.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
It's like a water siphon, which I have patented. I've been researching it since 2008.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
And are these two different?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
No, this one would be sealed, and this is its interior. In other cases, it's made of a gel that, as it is used, the gel is wasted, requiring replacement.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
Omar, so the only thing visible is the drain on top?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Yes, that's right, just the drain on top. This remains covered inside the wall of the urinal.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
How much did you sell last year, in 2022, Omar?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
I've sold approximately 500000 pesos since the research began, from 2008 until 2018 when I received the patent.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
Is this already a mold you have?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
No.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
Or is this a 3D print?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
I make this myself using traditional tools.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
Okay.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Does that mean you currently don't have a space, a factory, or a place where you manufacture them with an installed capacity to produce a certain number of pieces? Or do you have that?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
That's why I need the investment. Mainly, I want to create jobs. Once we have a demand of 5,000 pieces per month, then we can start scaling up.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
How many can one person manufacture per day or per week?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
One person can manufacture 300 pieces per month.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
And what is your sale price per piece?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
The sale price, I have sold it for 2,300 pesos.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
And what is your cost?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
The trap costs me 200 pesos to manufacture, and I have sold it for 2,300.

[Brian Requarth - Man]
That's a good margin.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Yes.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
How much do the cartridges currently cost? To understand the return on investment a client would have by purchasing this solution.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Users who need a cartridge replacement do so approximately every two months.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
And how much does the replacement cost?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Around 2000 pesos.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Oh.

[Brian Requarth - Man]
Omar, how do you know there will be demand, and what is your projected demand?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
In 2018, I had some approaches from companies. One store alone was offering to purchase 600 units monthly. Another ceramic manufacturing company was requesting 500 pieces of just the trap and, over a year, 5,000 pieces monthly.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
And at wholesale, to those types of clients, at what price do you sell the device?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
We are settling on about 800 pesos for the device.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
Hey Omar, you mentioned that in 2018 you had interest from a company. What has happened in those four years? It's not helpful for us to know that you had interest back in 2018.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
From 2018, when negotiations started, they restricted me from publishing or marketing it, so they could make a new launch. But just when the deal was about to close, we were in the process of finalizing prices and everything, the pandemic hit. The pandemic halted the project.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
Did you sell any units last year?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Last year, I sold very few units, around 100 pieces and about 50 urinals.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
If you didn't sell much, how do you arrive at the valuation of asking us for one million pesos for 15%?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Based on the previous offers I had from companies, the amounts they were interested in. I can guarantee a return on investment in, at most, two years.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Do the math for me, how will you return the investment in two years?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
I'm projecting to sell 28 million pesos in the first year.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
This year?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Yes. And 56 million pesos in the second year.

[Brian Requarth - Man]
Omar, I am always happy to see people with environmentally conscious projects. That's important and fundamental. Water is a relevant issue. For me, this isn't a product where I can add value. I don't see how I would be a partner who could help you in this process. Therefore, I'm out.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Okay, thank you.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
Your business isn't well-structured. You don't have clarity in your numbers yet. An expectation of 28 million pesos is crazy, it's an unrealistic expectation. Look, I'm telling you this, and you're already disagreeing. So I think not only is your business perhaps poorly structured, but maybe you won't listen to what I have to say. For those reasons, I'm out.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Consider us as if we were your guinea pigs, potential clients you could have. So that when you present yourself to those manufacturers or major brand marketers, you can tell them, "I do this, this, and this." Because if you come to me and say, "I have only one employee who can make 300 units, and I made it by hand," how can I place an order for 500, 2,000, or 5,000 units if you'll never deliver them on time? But it's important that this serves as a learning experience so that future clients aren't out but want to work with you. For all these reasons, I'm out.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
I think you need to structure your company much better. You need to start selling, testing the concept, and proving that you truly have the capacity to operate a factory like this. Once you have that, then you can approach a shark. But I think you came too early, and you haven't demonstrated that you have the capacity to achieve what you've proposed. That's why I'm out.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Okay.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
There's nothing I like more than supporting Mexican inventors. I believe it's what we need most. There are very few patents in this country.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Inventing is a monumental task.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
It truly is.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Inventing and creating products for improvement.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
I think the problem you have, besides coming too early, is that this specific project has, look, it has technological risk, market risk, production risk. You have all the risks in the world, and you're also coming with a very high valuation relative to where the project currently stands, not what it's potentially worth.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Yes, of course.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
But you need to validate it, and that's what you lack. And that's why I'm out.
