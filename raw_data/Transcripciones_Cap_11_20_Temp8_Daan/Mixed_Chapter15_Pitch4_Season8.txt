[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Hello, little chick Sharks, my name is Alexandra Satizábal.

[Speaker 2 - Man]
And mine is Andrés Combariza.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
And we are the little chicks, creators of Pescuezo.

[Speaker 2 - Man]
We produce joy that dresses and protects the neck through multifunctional garments for the head and neck. They protect us from cold, sun, dust, and wind.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
This chicken coop was born in Colombia. In 2012, we started with 7 dollars. By December 2022, we had sold more than 3 million dollars. In 2019, we were on Shark Tank Colombia. We were the bite of the week and closed the deal with the Shark who specializes in digital businesses. In 2019, Comba, as we call him, wanted to visit Cancún, and I told him no because it seemed too expensive to me.

[Speaker 2 - Man]
However, my dream of getting to know Mexico wasn't going to stay unfulfilled. And the magic of the chicken made it possible. I found an event, we came, and we funded our vacation. We sold absolutely everything. For the past three years, we have continued coming. We opened our operation here, set up a warehouse, and began scheduling sports events, fairs, and bazaars.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
That's why we want you, Sharks, to put on the feathers and help us grow this Mexican chicken coop. We're seeking 900,000 pesos for 15% of the chicken coop. Welcome to the chicken coop.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Very good.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
You're asking for 900000 pesos for 15% of the Mexican chicken coop.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Correct.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
And how much have you sold in the Mexican chicken coop? Tell us about your Mexican numbers.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
So, in 2019 we came for 14 days and sold 127000 pesos, focusing mainly on events. In 2021, we returned, stayed for 20 days, and sold 200000 pesos. Then we came back in 2022 for 22 days and sold 205000 pesos. By that time, we already had our warehouse operating in Mexico and sold an additional 70,000 pesos to distributors or wholesale sales, we already have some points of sale. And our website, which started operating in 2022, has historical sales of 10500 pesos.

[Speaker 2 - Man]
The company is divided into a sports line, a fashion line, and finally an industrial line for protection.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
How much does the whole company sell? How much did you sell in 2022?

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
In Colombia, we sold 9 million Mexican pesos last year.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Could you give us an idea about prices?

[Speaker 2 - Man]
The catalog ranges from 170 pesos to 400 pesos.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Okay.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
So, in Mexico, do you need an operator? Do you already have one, or is it just the money?

[Speaker 2 - Man]
Our flight is designed as a transportation plan with three stages. The first flight is a store that makes the brand visible, generates trust with our customers, and lets them experience more than just events. The second flight is selling to specialized stores in sports, motorcycling, and fashion. And the third flight is our website.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
There's a very strong American brand. How do you compete with them? Price?

[Speaker 2 - Man]
No, more than on price, we focus on history, marketing, and our chicken coops. Being so authentic in our language allows people to remember us more and have fun with the brand.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
I'm still a bit confused. Are you inviting us to the entire company or just to a new company you're creating in Mexico?

[Speaker 2 - Man]
We're inviting you to the dream of the Mexican chicken coop.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Well, the dream of the Mexican chicken coop is still a dream. And you're already valuing your company at 6 million pesos.

[Speaker 2 - Man]
I believe that even the numbers in Mexico will grow so much, they've shown significant growth in just a few months, that with Mexico, we'd have the entire Latin American journey.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
Andrés, I don't necessarily agree. If you come for a few days and sell 100000 or 200000 pesos, that doesn't prove the Mexican market will grow like the Colombian one. For example, what's your customer repeat rate? Do customers buy again?

[Speaker 2 - Man]
They come back a lot. In fact, we have customers who send us photos of mountains of underwear, mountains of neckwear.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
What percentage is repeat purchases? Let's talk data, not anecdotes.

[Speaker 2 - Man]
Currently, we're at about 20%.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
Okay, that's very good.

[Speaker 2 - Man]
It's very good.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
Hey, feathered Sharks, fewer questions, more offers. Less clucking.

[Speaker 2 - Man]
Lots of clucking.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
I want to go see the products.

[Speaker 2 - Man]
Please, welcome to the chicken coop.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
While Ale is checking out the products, where did you get the idea that a company selling 275000 pesos a year is worth 6 million pesos?

[Speaker 2 - Man]
Because it's not per year.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
It's over 56 days.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
Okay, but if we multiply it by 7, 250000 times 7, that's 1750000 pesos. Even assuming you can multiply it like that because in 50 days you only sold those 207000 pesos. We're talking about sales of 1750000. You're still asking for more than three times your sales.

[Speaker 2 - Man]
But keep in mind, during those days we didn't have wholesale operations, our own store, or even a fully operational website.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Alexandra and Comba, I like everything. I use them a lot. It's a good product. I think the valuation is high, as Karla pointed out. I'm willing to offer you 450000 pesos if any of my fellow Sharks would like to join me. And obviously, with a valuation of perhaps 15% for me and 15% for the other. Does any of you feel like joining me? Any Shark?

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
I'm thinking.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
I've seen many Colombian entrepreneurs who have tried to conquer Mexico. I believe what makes the difference between those who succeed and those who don't is the ability to establish a firm presence. And I see you planning to manage Mexico from Colombia.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
We've done very diligent work on processes in Colombia, and everyone is very clear about their role. So whether we're in Colombia or Mexico, we can manage it without a problem.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
Hey, chickens. There's a lot of chatter in the chicken coop.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
You've stirred up the hens.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
I think Ale seems eager to tell you something.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Yes, I really like the product. It's all made in Colombia with Colombian fabrics. I like the idea. I'm a bit concerned about the operation in Mexico, and the valuation makes me less convinced. But fortunately, it's a business I know. So I'd like to join Marisa's offer, but we're going to change it.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Okay.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
It will be 900000 pesos for 30% of the company, but we also want a royalty of 10 pesos per neckwear until we recover our investment, and then the royalty ends.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
Hey, I have FOMO, you didn't invite me to your chicken coop.

[Speaker 2 - Man]
We have another little hen.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Do you want to join?

[Karla Berman - Woman]
So that you get the largest part of the deal.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Well, we can make it 300000, 300000, 300000, 10, 10, and 10.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
And 10, 10, and 10.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
And you already have feathers.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
But I would have to ask that you come to live in Mexico at least half the time.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
Exactly.

[Speaker 2 - Man]
No.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Me, happily.

[Speaker 2 - Man]
Yes, we love Mexico. We have a deal.
