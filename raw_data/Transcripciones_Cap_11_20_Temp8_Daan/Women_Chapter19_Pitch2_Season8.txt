[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Hello, sharks. My name is Valeria Rangel.

[Speaker 2 - Woman]
And I'm Paola Santos. We are revolutionizing the textile industry, wholesale and retail without inventory. We are a Mexican company, and we personalize products under a print-on-demand model.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
It all began in 2017, in a class during my first semester at university. Imagine a 19-year-old Valeria, with her entrepreneurship class, a seed capital of 2000 pesos, and a strong desire to get a perfect score in the subject. That's when Mexico saw pillows with faces for the first time.

[Speaker 2 - Woman]
We have two distribution centers, one in the north of the country and one in Mexico City. We have more than 40 products, with our main ones being blankets, socks, and boxers.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
In 2021, we sold 2850000 pesos. In 2022, we sold 2400000 pesos. And now, in 2023, so far this year, we've sold 600000 pesos. With a gross profit margin of 34% and a net profit margin of approximately 23%, on average across our 40 products in the catalog.

[Speaker 2 - Woman]
We are asking for 500000 pesos for a 7% stake in our company.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
So we brought you some gifts that we hope you'll really like.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
We love gifts.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
Thank you very much.

[Speaker 2 - Woman]
No, thank you.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Oh, look at Amaury.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
I got the big face.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
Thank you very much.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
Thanks.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Haha, Amaury.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
I think I already know I'm going to use it. Look, I have a new one.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
Just look at that.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Oh, thank you very much.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
No, please, look at this.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Let's see, Marisa. Ah.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
What you're holding in your hands right now is one of our more than 40 products in our catalog, ranging from Hawaiian shirts, face pillows, sweatshirts, and onesies.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Karla, you have the new exercise set.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
I have the exercise kit.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
This is like for the beach, isn't it?

[Speaker 2 - Woman]
For those 10,000 steps every day.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
No, this is for when you're at home watching movies. It's a "hoagie", which is a mix between a blanket and a sweatshirt.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
The fabric is wonderful.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Yes, with warm fabric, and it's one-size-fits-all.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
So you can print on any type of fabric?

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
That's right, as long as it's polyester.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Oh, it has to be polyester.

[Speaker 2 - Woman]
Yes, it has to be polyester.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Okay, that's unfortunate because I prefer cotton.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
Tell me a little bit. Why couldn't someone else do this just like you?

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
Why couldn't someone else? Because we feel that this is a type of business where you need to have a certain personality to be able to make these kinds of unique products.

[Speaker 2 - Woman]
We make each product unique, from scratch and from the raw material until it's delivered to the final customer.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
But let me ask you something, following up. So none of this is protected with a patent, let's say?

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
It can't be because we can't patent each person's face.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
No, no, no, but the technology to print on polyester isn't yours.

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
It's sublimation. It's patented worldwide.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
What have you done differently this year to have sales of 600,000 pesos in these two months? Which indicates that, following this trend, you'll have sales of 3.6 million pesos. That is, you'll significantly improve your sales this year. What have you done differently?

[Speaker 1 - Woman]
The truth is that two things happened. The first is that we graduated from university, so now our full time is dedicated to the business. No more exams or homework and all those things that took up, well, time that was invested in education, right? So now we are full time in the business, and that's why it helped grow sales. And we also invested a lot in marketing. We put a lot into paid advertising campaigns on social media and also email marketing, which helped us a lot.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
What is your customer acquisition cost?

[Speaker 2 - Woman]
Right now, the customer acquisition cost varies due to the fact that it's a seasonal and cyclical business at the moment, where...

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Why? Explain to us why it's cyclical.

[Speaker 2 - Woman]
Because Christmas and Valentine's Day are our sales peaks, and at that time, whatever you invest in marketing, we have had an acquisition cost of up to 23 pesos, 18 pesos per ad conversion to the website.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
When it's not high season, what's your customer acquisition cost?

[Speaker 2 - Woman]
Let's see, in high season, we're below 50 pesos on average, and in low season, we can reach up to 180.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
And the repeat purchase rate?

[Speaker 2 - Woman]
2.73%.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Repeat purchases?

[Speaker 2 - Woman]
Repeat purchases.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
So almost nobody repurchases.

[Speaker 2 - Woman]
No, and that's precisely what we want to generate. We want to build more community, to be present in every special occasion and never fail. So that whenever it's grandma's birthday, your dog's birthday, whatever it is, we can be present, giving the unexpected.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
I really like both of you.

[Speaker 2 - Woman]
Thank you.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Honestly, you're good girls, you're doing something fun and cool, but honestly, I feel that this is just generating useless waste. Sorry, but I'm somewhat against these kinds of things, which are something for a gesture, something nice to give, funny, entertaining, but it's just a one-time thing that will probably end up in the trash or last a short while, and that's it. I'm out.

[Speaker 2 - Woman]
Thank you very much.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
I think there's a market where people will buy this; I think gift shops or an original gift could work, but I don't see long-term growth, and that's why I'm out.

[Speaker 2 - Woman]
Thank you.

Valeria and Paola, first of all, congratulations because you know your business very well, you know your numbers very well. There wasn't a single question they asked you, Paola, that you didn't know the exact data.

[Speaker 2 - Woman]
Thank you.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
And that's commendable. I think you're doing well. It's not a topic that I'm passionate about, and I don't see it as scalable, and above all, what worries me the most is the low barrier to entry. I mean, anyone who buys a machine like the one you have for printing can print with any kind of design, and for those reasons, I'm out.

[Speaker 2 - Woman]
Thank you.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
Valeria, Paola, I want to ask you a question, but don't give me the answer, okay? I want to ask if you see yourselves doing this all your life. And whatever the answer is, I believe that this is not a business, I'm almost sure it's not a business that you imagine doing all your life. I'm not saying you should give up, but I see you as great entrepreneurs, with a good attitude, you know your numbers, you're young, and I want to invite you to think about how this can evolve into something with more impact. And I think you have the potential, from what little I sense, to achieve much bigger things. This can be a great business for you to kickstart your next big business; it can be an interesting income that you're already building, but I would suggest that you set a much bigger next goal than what you have now, and that this can be a springboard to get to that point. And maybe there you could catch me as an investor. At this moment, I'm out.

[Speaker 2 - Woman]
Thank you.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
I wish you much success.

[Speaker 2 - Woman]
Thank you very much.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
Valeria and Paola, I love the drive you have. I think for being university students, you have achieved a lot. I think you're underestimating how fierce competition can become, and there's no technology protected by any patent, but I am, like Amaury, very eager to see how you will, with this, fund your next venture. I'm out.
