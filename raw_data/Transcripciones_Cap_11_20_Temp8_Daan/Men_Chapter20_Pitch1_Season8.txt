[Speaker 1 - Man]
Hello, sharks. It pains us to know that 8 out of 10 teenagers worldwide have acne problems and that in Mexico there is only one dermatologist for every 50000 inhabitants. Fortunately, the American Academy of Dermatology states that over 80% of dermatological diseases can be diagnosed and treated through a video consultation. We are Armando Soltero, CMO, and Arturo Martínez, CEO, and together with a prestigious dermatologist and a great programmer, we developed My NextDerma. My NextDerma is an application that provides dermatological consultations via video call at an affordable cost. If the patient wishes, they can purchase the treatment through our pharmacy. A successful strategy we use is analyzing the best-selling products and having them produced under our own brand to offer more accessible treatments. We launched in June 2020, and during that year, we managed to sell 1.7 million pesos. Last year, 2022, we sold 8.5 million pesos.

[Speaker 2 - Man]
We are in the preparation stage to launch in the United States and Colombia. Additionally, we have included specialties like psychology and nutrition to provide comprehensive treatment. We are happy because 100% of our patients who have followed their treatment have obtained favorable results. We offer a total satisfaction guarantee: if in six months they do not see improvement in treatable diseases like acne, we refund their money.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
We are among the few fortunate Mexicans to be accepted into Y Combinator. With their support and that of Harvard, we managed to raise $400000.

[Speaker 2 - Man]
And we are proud that in the last month, we generated profits of 150,000 pesos. At this rate, we will close 2023 with 12 million in sales and a net profit of 30%. We would like to raise a total of 2.4 million pesos for 10% of the company, at a valuation of 24 million pesos. We believe that in two and a half years, you could recover your investment due to the pace, growth, and results we have been achieving over the last year, especially in the last semester.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Of those 8.5 million pesos you sold last year, how much was in products and how much was in consultations?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
It was 70% in products and 30% in consultations. What happens is that these are specialty products, and being more expensive, they significantly raise the ticket size.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
And producing yourselves, as you explained, you had chosen the best-selling products, extracted the formula, and prepared your own formulas and creams. Can you tell me a bit about how the process was and how you chose? The laboratory that made them and all the formulation to achieve something of optimal quality?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
There are laboratories that offer services like personalization or putting your own brand on their products. They already have their formulas; they have everything tested. So their value proposition is, "I manufacture with your brand." That's how we achieved it.

[Alejandro Litchi - Man]
So there's no differentiator; it's the same formula you can find in other creams.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
It's the same formula but 25% to 50% cheaper than a commercial brand.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
How much does each consultation cost?

[Speaker 2 - Man]
The first one is 100 pesos as a customer acquisition strategy, and follow-up consultations are 400 pesos. They end up being very affordable because the market average is 1000 to 1200 pesos. So, well, the dermatologists partly do it also as a social transcendence project because they see that this is generating a significant impact.

[Alejandro Litchi - Man]
Could you show me the products? Are there two or three different ones?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
We have almost 40.

[Alejandro Litchi - Man]
Forty SKUs?

[Karla Berman - Woman]
And how many dermatologists do you have affiliated with the platform?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
At the moment, we have six dermatologists.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
Six?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Yes.

[Alejandro Litchi - Man]
If you want to pass some over there, just so they can see them.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
They have an approximate capacity of 2000 consultations.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
Two thousand consultations per...?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Per month. The dermatologists' consultations last 15 minutes. We automate everything so that before having a consultation, the patient fills out their record, uploads their images, and completes a questionnaire that helps the dermatologist diagnose.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
You mentioned you've already raised $400000. At what valuation? What percentage of the company do you hold? How much have you already given up to other investors? Tell us a bit about your numbers.

[Speaker 2 - Man]
In general terms, we hold 100% among the four partners, having been the founders. That's how we split it.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Did you all split equally?

[Speaker 2 - Man]
No, I, having made the initial investment of one million pesos and one million in credit that I requested, kept 40%, and my three partners hold 20% each. Let's say I assumed practically all the economic risk in the first year while we were accepted or managed to get funded. The valuation was about 12 million dollars, and what we gave up was approximately 8.2%.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
Wait, wait, sorry. The valuation at which you raised $400000 was 12 million dollars?

[Speaker 2 - Man]
Yes, correct.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
And now you're raising at the same valuation?

[Speaker 2 - Man]
No, we are doing a special round considering that...

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
At 1.2 million dollars.

[Speaker 2 - Man]
With you, we are doing this round or this special consideration because it's not only money that we're seeking. We know that with your expertise, your contacts, your work teams, we could create a special category that could be the most convenient to not affect the existing legal structure.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
What are you looking for in the tank? What kind of partner are you seeking?

[Speaker 2 - Man]
Without a doubt, we see that it's a spectacular business that in two and a half years can return interesting profits and can become a company worth 100 million or a billion. But let's not forget the underlying part, which is to change or generate transcendence, a social altruism.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
I understand you are focused on dermatology, but how do you defend yourselves against competitors who offer all medical services on a single platform?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
They are usually medical directories, and what we have is an all-in-one application. You have your medical record, your schedule; you can have your video consultation through the same application, and within it, you can purchase the treatment. That's the difference compared to other directories.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
This is the kind of business I love to invest in. It's a business that solves a real problem, has a significant market, and the business model is quite clear, they take 30% from the patients. The valuation is two times this year's sales, which seems to me a very attractive valuation. So it sounds very impressive. I think that if you go and tell your partners that you came to Shark Tank to give up 10% of your company at a valuation, if I'm not mistaken, ten times less, they'll kill you. I don't want to be in that room, so for that reason, I'm out.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Your growth is impressive from 2021 to 2022, which validates your project, which I also think is wonderful, and I like the social aspect. I'm considering making you an offer. Alejandro and Alejandra, would you like us to make an offer together, the three of us?

[Alejandro Litchi - Man]
With you, without hesitation, Marisa.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Look, I can be part of the conversation when you have it with your partners, and we can explain why we bring value to the table and why the valuation has decreased. I think if you come with this confidence to offer at this valuation, the key here is also to trust a bit, trust in what you tell us.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
But can I say something? I mean, it's a catastrophe. What I mean is, any company...

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
It doesn't matter. But you won't be part of the catastrophe, don't worry. Nothing will happen.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
It's a catastrophe for...

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
For them.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
For them.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
They've already been given the money, and we're going to support them and give them...

[Karla Berman - Woman]
No, but it's a catastrophe for you to lower your valuation by 20.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Yes, but all companies have adjusted their valuations lately.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
Not by 20.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Not by 20, by 10.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
Ten.

[Speaker 2 - Man]
We have seen precedents of companies that, precisely because of advice, support, and enrichment, have managed to make these clauses, these negotiations, or, to say, for these reasons, a special category was made because these objectives are contributed. So that's, let's say, our expectation.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
Sure, but for 1%?

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
We offer you 2.4 million pesos.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Three sharks.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
Three sharks for 15% of the company.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Five, five, and five.

[Speaker 2 - Man]
We would like to make you a counteroffer that's also very juicy, very interesting.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
Before that, let me say something. I'm convinced that many of these young people you mentioned who have acne problems, if they had better nutrition, wouldn't need products like these or dermatological ones. I have great respect for dermatologists, truly. Unfortunately, there are many dermatologists who only solve the problem once it's out of control, instead of going to the root of the disease or problem. I am on paths opposite to yours. I want to prevent them, prevent those diseases and not solve them after they are already a problem. But from the root, not afterward. And for those reasons, I'm out.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
So, do we have a deal?

[Speaker 2 - Man]
We have a deal.
