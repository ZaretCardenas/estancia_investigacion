[Speaker 1 - Male]
Hello, sharks, I'm Zack, and this is my boss, Pancho Vegan. We opened Fat Vegan at the end of 2019 to fight against a growing, frustrating, and totally unnecessary problem. And what was the problem? Fast food restaurants with mediocre food. We spent an entire year developing our dishes, dishes so juicy and so fat that they can stain your face but never your conscience, because our burger isn't made with meat but with huitlacoche, ayocote beans, soy, and seitan. The wings aren't made of chicken but tofu, and the milkshake is ice cream made with plant-based milks. With over eight million pesos in annual sales, a trained kitchen ready to produce for multiple locations, and a dedicated and passionate team, we're ready to scale. I've had the opportunity in my career to oversee the opening of several concepts. In my previous experience, which was in New York, I was the Director of Operations for a chain where we opened nine restaurants. So when I saw that Fat Vegan wasn't just going to be a burger joint in Roma but something else, we started thinking more about how to find people capable of taking on something a bit bigger, a chef and all that. Since then, we've been very focused on this. And we're here today seeking strategic partners and an investment of two million pesos in exchange for 15% of the company. Who's up for a taste?

[Alejandra Ríos - Female]
I am! You're making us want to try it. It smells good, that's for sure.

[Speaker 1 - Male]
Here you have the Fat Vegan burger, which is our classic burger. The milkshakes, some of you have "La Querida," which has vanilla ice cream with cake and strawberry, and others have the "Natty Vegan," which has peanut butter, chocolate, and banana. Some barbecue wings and some fries.

[Alejandra Ríos - Female]
What inspired you to create this brand? The brand is super cool.

[Speaker 1 - Male]
Well, when I moved to Mexico City, that was about five years ago, I always ate at home, almost 100% plant-based food, for a long time. But when I craved a burger, I didn't have anywhere to go. And then it was like, aha, there's something missing in the market here. And from there, we started developing the recipes.

[Amaury Vergara - Male]
Zach, tell me about your sales in 2020, 2021, and 2022.

[Speaker 1 - Male]
In 2020, we ended the year with 5.5 million. And that was quite an adventure for me because we opened in December 2019. In January, sales doubled; February was phenomenal, and then in March, everything fell apart. And I really had to change my mindset and learn something else, which was delivery, how to tackle another market that I didn't know. So by June or July, we had recovered the sales we had in February and ended the year strong. The next year, in 2021, we sold about 7.5 million, and last year 8.5.

[Amaury Vergara - Male]
Zach, who's your ideal shark?

[Speaker 1 - Male]
Shark or sharkess?

[Amaury Vergara - Male]
I'm talking about all sharks of any gender, but ideally, shark or sharkess.

[Speaker 1 - Male]
Of course, Ale and Marisa have experience in this line of business, right? So I'd love to partner with them, but equally with everyone. So whoever has faith in my business, who sees it with the magic and passion that I see it, well, they're welcome.

[Marisa Lazo - Female]
Ale, would you be interested in us making an offer together?

[Alejandra Ríos - Female]
What I liked most here is your experience as an operator. Because the most difficult thing in this type of business is not the brand, creating an incredible brand, or creating delicious recipes, that's not the hardest part. The hardest part is execution, operating. And I think that with the experience you have, it gives me confidence to invest in this business with you. So I was also talking here with Brian, who is interested.

[Marisa Lazo - Female]
We can all three get involved. And you'd also get someone super tech-savvy.

[Alejandra Ríos - Female]
The offer we'd like to make is 2.1 million pesos for 21% of your business so that each of us would have at least 7%, and that would motivate us to get more involved in your business.

[Marcus Dantus - Male]
Well, I would make you an offer, but I mean, how can I compete? There's no way. I don't know what Amaury is going to say. I'm not stepping out yet.

[Amaury Vergara - Male]
I think there are already too many sharks in the water, and for those reasons, I'm out.

[Alejandra Ríos - Female]
Wait, Amaury. I know you like all this, and I see that Marcus hasn't stepped out. What would you all think, and I'm opening this up to everyone, if we made a joint offer, all five of us?

[Marisa Lazo - Female]
No, I say no, Ale. Because if not, I mean, I think giving up more than 21% doesn't suit him. And for less than 7%, we'd each get five or four percent. We'd be too divided and all participating. I think it's better if it's the three of us.

[Brian Requarth - Male]
Yes, I agree, I agree. I like the generous spirit you have, but that's for us.

[Marisa Lazo - Female]
Yes, better just the three of us.

[Amaury Vergara - Male]
So, Ale, can I step out or...?

[Alejandra Ríos - Female]
Well, yes, go ahead.

[Amaury Vergara - Male]
I'm out. Much success, Zach.

[Speaker 1 - Male]
Thank you very much.

[Marcus Dantus - Male]
Zach, before I step out, I'm just going to ask you a favor: open something near my house. We'll talk later. Sadly, I'm stepping out. I'm out.

[Marisa Lazo - Female]
Zach and Pancho Vegan, what do you think of our proposal of taking on three sharks instead of two?

[Speaker 1 - Male]
I think if you can raise the offer to 2.4 million, we have a deal.

[Brian Requarth - Male]
For the same percentage?

[Speaker 1 - Male]
For the same percentage.

[Brian Requarth - Male]
So, to summarize, 2.4 million for 21% among the three of us.

[Brian Requarth - Male]
Alright, that's fine, that's fine. We have a deal.
