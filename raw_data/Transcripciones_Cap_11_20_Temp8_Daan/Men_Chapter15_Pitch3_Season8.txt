[Speaker 1 - Man]
Hello, Sharks. We are Leonardo and Leonardo Castañeda, father and son, and we're here to present Cross Country Adventure. It's a company dedicated to designing and marketing products for outdoor adventure enthusiasts.

[Speaker 2 - Man]
We are known for being a Mexican brand that is already featured in international showcases, offering the highest quality products with features like technology, design, and comfort. We have a 100% Mexican workforce, skilled and highly competitive on a global level.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
The inception of the brand comes from an accident or assault I experienced. I was mugged and got shot in the leg, damaging my femoral artery. It literally knocked me down to the point where, psychologically, when I woke up after that event, I had a lot of time to analyze what I wanted to do with this second chance at life. I've been a footwear salesman for a little over 20 years, and I sought a way to capitalize on that to provide some security for my family. We did it in such a way that we thought of a business model inspired by a beautiful success story in a movie about how some Californian farmers became cross-country champions. That's where this adventure comes from, right?

[Speaker 2 - Man]
We have two ways of marketing the brand: business-to-business and business-to-customer. In the second form, we have our own e-commerce platform, which sold 200000 pesos in 2021 and around 4 million pesos in 2022, experiencing significant growth and becoming one of the company's most important clients today.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Last year, we sold about 16 and a half million pesos already. We have an average weighted cost of 450 pesos per item, and this gave us these kinds of results. We had profits of about 2.4 million pesos, more or less. Based on that, we'd like to ask one of you to join the cross-country adventure and put on some shoes, requesting one million pesos for 5% of the company.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Where is your clothing and footwear factory located?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Actually, the factory isn't mine, but it's a friend's who offered it to me completely. He said, "Do whatever you want." But we decide everything from the density of the sole, the materials, the design, the branding, practically everything for Cross Country.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
And the shirts? Where do you manufacture them?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
The shirts are likewise made by another client of ours who decided to partner with us. He has very good craftsmanship.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
So, to understand, you design and decide on the finishes, and you have two people who manufacture your products, and then you market them.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
A bit more than just two manufacturers. Yes, we have a bit more because another person makes the belts, another makes the hats. Yes, another person does it for us. Some things we do make ourselves.

[Speaker 2 - Man]
We also have T-shirts, and there's another person who decided to collaborate with us by doing exchanges. "I'll make the T-shirts, and you let me upload your Cross Country products to my Mercado Libre account, and for whatever sells, we do dropshipping, we ship it."

[Karla Berman - Woman]
Very impressive that you went from 200,000 pesos to 4 million pesos in your e-commerce. Are those 4 million pesos from your own e-commerce or does it include other platforms?

[Speaker 2 - Man]
No, it's purely our own e-commerce, just crosscountry.com.mx.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
Perfect.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
And the remaining 8 million you sold last year, where are they from?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
From wholesale.

[Speaker 2 - Man]
From wholesale sales.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
Tell me a bit more about that.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Well, we sell through other platforms. Since I've been a salesman for 20 years, I have a fairly large client portfolio.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
So, local shoe stores throughout the country.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
We have several distribution channels. It's a boot that's not too expensive but not too cheap either.

[Karla Berman - Woman]
And how do customers find your e-commerce?

[Speaker 2 - Man]
Through my advertising. I handle advertising on social networks, I have my design and marketing team, and I'm the one who places ads on social media.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
Are they all boots as part of your footwear?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Unfortunately, we had to deviate a bit from the expertise we had with utility boots, like hiking boots, because customers were asking us for other types of items to meet different needs.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
You tell us you have marketing, but you have an average margin of 25.9%.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
That's right.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
And you're reporting total sales of 16.5 million pesos and a profit of 2.4 million.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
That's correct.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Could it be that your margin is before taxes? Is it gross?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Yes.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Okay.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
Leonardo and Leonardo, before more questions, I really want to congratulate you, Leonardo Sr., for having your son here, and Leonardo Jr., for doing something with your dad. You made me remember my dad and me many years ago.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Thank you very much.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
Congratulations.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
That's awesome.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Yes, it's a beautiful adventure.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
Are both of you partners in the company?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
He's not yet listed in the articles of incorporation; we'll see which wife he ends up with.

[Marcus Dantus - Man]
Your sale price compared to the most famous brand of this type of boots in the United States is about half the price?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
More or less.

[Speaker 2 - Man]
A little less than half.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
I want to make you an offer. Your products are truly of incredible quality, and I really like you as entrepreneurs.

[Speaker 1 - Man]
Oh, thank you.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
There's one condition: that Leonardo Jr. joins the business now and is included in the articles of incorporation.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
I was just about to say that, Ale.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
See? We're connected, Amaury. The offer I'm going to make is 1.2 million pesos for 12% of the company. And I'm going to open up the opportunity for Amaury and maybe Marisa, who I see is enthusiastic, to join my offer. So if they agree, what I'm thinking is that we'd each invest 1.2 million, 400000 each, for 12% equity, split evenly.

[Amaury Vergara - Man]
I'm in.

[Marisa Lazo - Woman]
Me too.

[Alejandra Ríos - Woman]
You guys? Are you in? Do we have a deal?

[Speaker 1 - Man]
We have a deal.
