How are you? My name is Mauricio Almeida and I am the director of Scouter. The first platform that allows millions of content creators to have access to millions of locations.

Renting them per hour, super easy, fast and safe. And on the other hand, it also allows millions of Mexicans to monetize almost any space. More than 25 categories of content.

That is, in Scouter, we rent from a flea market for fashion photos to an airplane, a football stadium. We rent almost any space. And that makes it very attractive for Mexicans because in this way they can monetize anything.

And as our motto says, any place is a good location. We started our project with an MVP in 2021 to measure how the market was. Which was a website that I made.

And the surprise was that very quickly we started to have rentals. The first rent was from my mom's house. I rented the kitchen for a food commercial.

And we earned 25,000 pesos in one day. After that, all my aunts, my mom's friends, everyone started sending me emails. And the day came when I could no longer answer so many emails.

We raised a round of capital with one of the strongest funds in Latin America and the most active. 500 Startups. And also with √Ångeles Inversionistas.

At this time, we built a much more robust platform where people can easily upload their location. Have legal certainty. Visible contracts for both parties.

Because I think this industry has not changed for many years. And it's time for it to change. In our first year with the platform, we sold 2.5 million pesos. This year we are expecting to sell around 16 million pesos. And for 2028, the expectations and the projection that we have of sales and growth is that we are going to sell around 400 million pesos. With a gross utility of 25%.

We are raising a round right now of 350,000 dollars in exchange for 5% of our company.

[sharkH 5]
When you say we sold 2.5 million pesos in 2022, do you mean that you placed 2.5 million pesos? 

[entrepreneurH 1]
That's what the company entered in terms of income. 

[sharkH 5]
Bookings.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Bookings, exactly. 

[sharkH 5]
In reality, you won the fourth part of that. 

[entrepreneurH 1]
Exactly.

[sharkH 5]
You charge 25% commission.

[entrepreneurH 1]
The business model works. We earn 30%. 20% if a person goes up.

I go up my kitchen in 1000 pesos per hour, right? Scouter, when he rents your kitchen, he's going to keep 20%. That is, you are going to earn 800 pesos net.

And we have a platform fee for the creators. By using the platform and finding more than 2000 locations in one second, we charge you 10%. Then we earn 30%.

And what is the most difficult side of Marketplace? Well, Marketplace always has the problem of the egg and the chicken, right? You have a lot of supply and then you have to worry about demand.

But in reality, at this moment, I would say that the spaces, right? We are investing heavily so that people understand that spaces have an intrinsic value because of the aesthetics of the space. That is, my grandmother has a house that she has not modified for 50 years.

That house has an aesthetic value because someone is looking for it. Some director in his head is thinking that he wants a house for that videoclip and he imagined it. No, then Scouter enters and puts a house of the 50s with tapestry walls.

And all the locations that have these characteristics in Mexico appear to him. 

[sharkM 5]
That is, you have a lot of demand. 

[entrepreneurH 1]
It is more the demand than the offer that we have of spaces today.

[sharkM 3]
Mauricio, how do you think they will grow from 2022, from two and a half million invoices to 16 million?

[entrepreneurH 1]
The first answer to that is because of the growth dynamics that we bring month by month in sales. We bring a dynamic of 35% growth month by month in sales and 15% approximately in locations and new users. Today we have 2,800 users actively registered on the platform looking for spaces.

[sharkH 5]
How is the CAC and the cost of acquisition of clients? 

[entrepreneurH 1]
Our acquisition cost last year depended a lot on the marketing efforts month by month. But it was approximately 4.5 dollars per user. And we have a repurchase of users who use the platform once 35%, which is very high. It is a brutality. 

[sharkH 5]
Do you think it's high?

[entrepreneurH 1]
I think it's high, yes.

[sharkH 5]
I think it's low. Ok. Because it means that those clients who enter, because of 10, less than 4 are left, right?

[entrepreneurH 1]
Yes, no, no, no. Less than 4, they buy again. But we also take into account that we have a lot of acquisition of new clients.

[sharkH 5]
Now, being fair, this is a business where it is not so common for a producer to repeat a location, right? 

[entrepreneurH 1]
It depends.But new locations, right?

[sharkH 5]
 Well, yes. How does it depend?I was trying to help you, Mauricio.

[entrepreneurH 1]
No, no, no.

[sharkH 5]
I don't mean that. Forget it.

[entrepreneurH 1]
It's fine.

[sharkM 5]
I finish helping you. The reality is that a tennis ad, maybe I have to do a campaign twice a year or three or four, but I'm not constantly taking pictures of my tennis.

[sharkH 5]
And not exactly in the same location.

[sharkM 5]
No, but it has a lot of locations. You can go back looking for another location.

[sharkH 5]
Well, that's true. That's what I mean. Who are your clients?
Tell me a little more about how it works.

[entrepreneurH 1]
If we split the company in two, we have the B2B part, which are producers, advertising agencies, very large brands that have internal marketing teams. The B2C is a quantity that are content creators of all kinds. Independent producers, filmmakers, independent photographers, art directors, a lot of people who need spaces to create and with whom they work and make money too.

[sharkH 5]
Okay.

[sharkH 5]
How much would one of your competitors charge to understand the size of their market?

[entrepreneurH 1]
Well, look, I honestly don't know how much he charges, but what I can tell you is that one of the companies that does what we do in the United States is valued at more than 100 million dollars.

[sharkM 5]
What prevents your competitors from beating you in the race?

[entrepreneurH 1]
At this moment in Latin America, the main thing is tropicalization and how we Latin Americans work. It's totally how it works in Europe and the United States. That's one.

And the other is that we are growing very fast. And honestly, and out of humility, I think it will be much easier for them to buy us than to get into a fight to investigate how the market works and all those things.

[sharkM 5]
Mauricio, I want to understand the security part. Because if I rent you my living room, the house or the kitchen of my house, a group of cameramen, a group of producers will come in, which I have never seen or know. Is there someone from your team who is present to take care of you?

Because it's not just breaking a vase.

[entrepreneurH 1]
The first is because you have direct contact with the person who is going to rent. You can talk to the person all the time through the chat and let them tell you what they are going to do, how many are going, what kind of producer he is, what is the name of his company. Or if it's a person, you can ask for any kind of identification.

Now, the other is, because I know that can't leave you very calm, when a person gives up on the platform, we have with technology a super simple API that connects to the IME and detects that the identification or passport that person put is him, right?

[sharkM 5]
Mauricio, you are a super enthusiastic entrepreneur. And you spread your emotion. And it is seen that it is a topic that you are passionate about.

That's very good. There are two things that make me hesitate to invest in you. One is, I find it difficult, even with your explanation, which was a good explanation and a broad explanation, of how you thought you would grow from 2.5 million to 16. I find it very difficult to get it in such a short time. And the second reason that makes me hesitate is your valuation. You come with a very high valuation, even with your enthusiasm, and you infect me with your name, your brand, your idea, which I find wonderful, super original, but you don't infect me with your numbers, and that's why I'm out.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Thank you very much, Marisa.

[sharkM 5]
Well, I have a bad one and a good one.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Okay.

[sharkM 5]
Which one do you want first?

[entrepreneurH 1]
The bad one.

[sharkM 5]
The bad one. I'm out.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Very good, thank you.

[sharkM 5]
Do you want the good one?

[entrepreneurH 1]
Yes.

[sharkM 5]
I'm also in. I'm an investor in that fund that already invested you, so indirectly I'm already your partner.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Oh, that's cool. Thank you very much.

[sharkM 5]
You're welcome.

[sharkH 5]
Mauricio, the good thing about that is that you have a business model that is low in capital, right? That's an advantage of yours. It doesn't require a lot of money to operate that, and it has a margin.

If you manage to scale the business, it could be an interesting margin, right? Of course. The main challenge you have is that I don't think they'll buy you, because that business is a winner that takes it all.

So that's why I'm out.

[sharkH 5]
Thank you very much. I'll continue with the format of the bad and the good one. I mean, I'm out because this is for a fund, but the good news is that you'll surely get a fund, and more today.
And if not, call me and we'll get you a fund. But this is for an investment fund. That's why I'm out.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Thank you, Marcos. Thank you.

[sharkH 5]
Diego, I'm against it because you're from home. I appreciate it. I love the project.
I love it. And I identify with you. In film, in production.
You made me remember the university. Location, location, location. And I definitely think it's a great solution, and it's an interesting market where a lot of money moves, and also very fast.
But I don't know if you're building or if you're going to sell at some point.

[entrepreneurH 1]
The idea is to build, build, build, build, build. And I think for the good of everyone here, it's to sell. Because that's the business, right?

[sharkH 5]
On the one hand, you're telling me, yes, we're going to sell. And on the other hand, you're telling me, let's conquer the market. And that contradiction doesn't drive me crazy as a shark.

[entrepreneurH 1]
And what would make sense to you? Well... If you like the project, I'd love to have you in it, you know?
I mean, what would make sense to you to say, okay, let's see how we do it, you know? I mean, the idea is to negotiate and get something that works for both of us, that you feel like you're doing an important challenge. You know, I have a partner like you who can open a lot of doors for me.

[sharkH 5]
You're making me think, huh? Which is not... It's not normal.

[sharkM 5]
Do  an offer. He's a very forward-looking guy.

[sharkH 5]
Yes, I like that a lot about you, old man. Um... Very.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Let's see. Let's see,

[sharkH 5]
I'm listening. 

[entrepreneurH 1]
Let's see. A capital part and a debt part. And you give me a chance to buy you in two years? If things go the way I want them to go.

[sharkH 5]
I offer you... for what you came to ask for, $350,000 for 7%. Half is capital, half is debt.

And you can buy me back 2.5% of the shares for me to stay at 4.5% later. Do we have a deal? We have a deal.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Deal.
