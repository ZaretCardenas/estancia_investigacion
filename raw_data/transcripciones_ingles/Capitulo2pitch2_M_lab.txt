And look, she's with Laura, the weirdo who likes anime.

This sounds awful, right? Well, this is the reality that 8 out of 10 young people live in our country. School harassment is something we have to end.

Not for nothing, it is one of the main causes of suicide in young people. I'm Ana Rosado, I'm a teacher in clinical psychology. And together with my sister, Lulu Rosado, we created this wonderful brand.

Growing People. A brand where we seek to reduce the psychological effects of discrimination. Specifically, school harassment.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Currently, we have four products in our brand. We have Grow Bird in two sizes. Our mosquito that you can see here.

You can order both with different body shapes. This is with or without any strangeness. This has helped us teach both children and adults that as human beings, we are all different.

We also have the story Luanismonstro. A book that teaches us about inclusion and personal acceptance. And the Growing workshops.

Those that help us bring the message of inclusion and self-love to schools. Currently, we have more than 100 sales and a school where we have taught workshops. We hope this month to be able to close sales with three more schools.

Sharks. We are looking for a strategic partner to help us so that Grow, along with its message, can reach more homes and educational centers. And with this, the message of inclusion.

We offer 20% of our company in exchange for 120,000 pesos. Sharks. Who joins the Grow world?

[sharkM 6]
What are you going to do with this money?

[entrepreneurM 1]
We have two areas with which we want to work. One is that we want to put marketing, social networks. And the second is that we want to fundamentalize our methodology so that we can enter schools with much more research.

Can I see one of the stories? Of course. In fact, you can go ahead.

We have a Grow for each one. You can go look for it. Each one has their name, so you will find it.

Come in.

[entrepreneurM 8]
Here? Yes. Ale, this is yours.

Thank you very much. Sorry, Adriana, this is yours. Thank you.

Alejandra Vichy is here.

[entrepreneurM 1]

There you will also find your book. 

[sharkM 6]

Mine has glasses.

[entrepreneurM 3]
Yes. It is because one of the ideas is that our Grow is a reflection of ourselves.

[entrepreneurM 1]
They each bring their adoption and personality cards where they explain who Grow is. And we have the packages that already include you in the book, which is the one you have in your hands right now.

[sharkH 5]
Ana and Lulu, they said you have 100 sales.

[entrepreneurM 1]
Yes, exactly.

[sharkH 5]
How much do these 100 sales add up in money?

[entrepreneurM 1]
In money, 127,000 pesos. 

[sharkM 5]
When did you start? 

[entrepreneurM 1]
March 27, 2020..

[sharkM 4]
Have you been in operation for almost three years?

[entrepreneurM 1]
Yes, yes, yes. Without taking into account ... Can I make a brief comment?

Yes. We started the brand with 2,000 pesos and the most we have invested in the brand has been 15,000 pesos. Really, one of the things we have been able to offer has been through investment.

When we started, they asked us to go to Mexico City. They asked us to do an anchorage so that we could bring more than 20 products and grow. Yes, we were very afraid because we have a character.

What if they copy us? We were very afraid. 

[sharkM 4]
How much does it cost?

[entrepreneurM 1]
We have several prices. We have the Grow Solo, which is the mini in 880, the big one in 950. And with the book, which is the complete package, there is the mini in 1,290, the big one in 1,330.

[sharkH 4]
Of the 100 goals you have had, have you seen any change in the children?

[entrepreneurM 1]
When the child arrived, after acquiring his GROC and told me, I got the GROC that has two arms and two legs, at that moment I knew that there was a GROC that did not have an arm and that did not have a leg. And that for me was like, wow, I did it. I think the most important thing in education is to teach children from an early age the differences between humans and to be different.

I think the only thing that makes us the same is as humans, that in the end we are all different.

[sharkH 4]
Ana, Lulu was looking at her book, which is very cool. How does this solve that problem? That is the part that is still not very clear to me.

[entrepreneurM 1]
The book is the book of Luani, who was bullied in elementary school. And like her, when we are bullied, we are facing different situations. Sometimes, if from a young age they told us, I don't like your hair, because of a comment, because they bullied us at school, all our lives we grow up with that, they don't like my hair.

As much as they are going to tell you, your hair is good, you already react. They are going to say that it's because of my hair, I'm already upset, I'm already angry, I'm already sad.

[sharkH 4]
Do you have any endorsement or any institution that can certify that your product generates these benefits in the mental health of young people?

[entrepreneurM 3]
A sustainable background, that is, that proves that our workshops can really change.

[sharkM 4]
I want to congratulate you for your social work, for creating awareness. And I think you are at a very early stage so that I, at least, want to make an investment. For that reason, I am out.

[sharkH 4]
The monkey is cool, the idea is cool that one has arms and one has legs, but unfortunately I am out. But I do recommend that you rethink things and see which way you want to go.

[entrepreneurM 1]
Thank you very much.

[sharkH 4]
Ana Lul√∫, you arrived at your pitch talking about a very big problem, right? And I don't know if this is necessarily proven to solve that problem. For that reason, I am out, but I wish you a lot of success.

[entrepreneurM 1]
Thank you very much.

[sharkH 4]
I'm not going to dare to give you a couple of tips, okay?

First you talked about fear, that's the first thing that stops entrepreneurs. The worst thing that can happen is that it doesn't work. Nothing happens, they go to the next one.

The second thing they have to do is validate their idea. Validate, as Mauri says, that the methodology works. And the third thing, and this is what they really lack.

Entrepreneurship is not the idea, we all have ideas. Entrepreneurship is execution. And they haven't executed.

I'm out.

[sharkM 4]
Look, your mission is great. I was captivated when they said they had a book to promote inclusion, diversity, to prevent bullying. But I'm very sorry to be a guard.

They have been in operation for three years, they have sold 100 pieces. They have had $120,000 in sales. In three years.

It's not a business. I'm out.

[entrepreneurM 1]
Thank you all very much.
