We are both agraveros and we belong to the IMAG company, a company that represents one of the most important traditions in our country, which is related to the agraveros fields.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Our company is a pioneer in the use of communication technology to democratize the agave sector, since it is a digital platform that allows anyone, from anywhere in the world, to buy and sell agave plants. Our business model also consists, in addition to technology, of offering an agricultural service that is in charge of the maintenance and care of the plants throughout the harvest. We currently have around 2 million plants in our meadows.

[entrepreneurM 1]
We sell the plants to our partners. They are given a registration and location contract for their plants. In addition to this, since the plant is a living being, it is kept in the fields where it was cultivated, and it is there where we provide an additional maintenance service that is carried out by our agronomists and specialists who accompany the plant to its final maturation.

[entrepreneurH 1]
We are here today looking for a strategic partner that provides us with value, that helps us consolidate and grow the company, and that is why we are offering 5% of the company in exchange for 2 million pesos. Sharks, who wants to join us in this industry called Mexican Blue Gold?

[sharkH 6]
You adopt a plant and then you sell it, I mean, I didn't understand the model.

[entrepreneurM 1]
We sell the plant to anyone who, without having knowledge of the cultivation of agave, can be agavero or agavera, and we take care of all the maintenance from start to finish.

[entrepreneurH 1]
In our buildings.

[sharkH 6]
And this is an investment vehicle for those who want to invest in agave?

[entrepreneurM 1]
We are in charge of looking for the buildings, buying the plant, workers' blocks, everything it requires until it is sown and sold.

[sharkH 6]
And then I go on a page and invest in buying 20 agave plants, and then you administer them to me, and in the end you give me my returns?

[entrepreneurM 1]
Yes, the minimum amount to be part of the company is a first purchase of at least 10,000 pesos. From there you can buy the amount you like, and in future purchases there is no longer a minimum.

[sharkH 6]
How much money do you have in agave plants managed by third parties?

[entrepreneurH 1]
The amount of plants is 2 million plants, which can be worth up to 300 million pesos. 

[sharkH 6]
What is the business model?
How much do you charge this person who is managing the plant?

[entrepreneurH 1]
We charge the person a commission of 35%, and at the end, when the sale is made, the one that will make the transformation of the plant. And while we charge him all the costs, for example, a plant costs 140 pesos, all the maintenance for 6 years, we charge the person for the plant and we take care of the whole process.

[sharkH 6]
And do you give the return once the harvest is over or do you give returns from before?

[entrepreneurM 1]
We have two options. One is the one you just mentioned, which is until it is sown and the plant is sold and it is already commercialized, or the second is that from the day the customer buys his plant, the next week he is already getting profits from the purchase he made.

[sharkM 6]
What has been the utility of the company since you started or in 2022 at least?

[entrepreneurH 1]
For example, in 2022 we burned our first property, a small property of 3,500 plants, and that generated a profit of 1,280,000 pesos for the company. In addition to that, on the platform, the customers who buy the plant can sell their plant and buy, and we charge a 5% fee. 

[sharkM 6]
Which is integrated into that utility?.

[entrepreneurM 1]
No, it independent 

[sharkH 6]
Let's see the total of how many income you had in 2022 

[entrepreneurH 1]
1,600,000 approximately in 2022. 

[sharkH 6]
And that is before operating expenses.

[sharkM 6]
No, what I asked was utility.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Yes, it is the utility of the company, because if we had sales of 65 million in 2022, the utility was 1,600,000.

[sharkH 6]
Do you have a competitor that is doing something similar in the agave industry? 

[entrepreneurH 1]
Quite a few. 

[sharkH 6]
The same, the same model? 

[entrepreneurH 1]
Yes. They just don't have the platform that we have, that we already have the digital platform, 

[sharkH 6]
and that technology was developed by you or is it a third party?

[entrepreneurH 1]
It is ours.

[entrepreneurH 1] 
No.

[sharkH 6]
I don't think they need an investment, but if they don't invest with pleasure, it helps them get those clients. I present to you the two largest crowdfunding companies in Mexico, and with that insurance, they get the money and the clients they need without spending much more. But for now, I'm out.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Thank you very much. 

[sharkH 6]
I do feel that this to scale and to make it big, the technology play has to be much more evident.
And although it sounds like a gigantic business, it is a business that I do not understand in terms of agro, and that is why I am out. Thank you. I know the industry.

I also know the opportunity there is, but I also know the aggressiveness and the competition there is with foreign investment, the agave. Although it is a resident plant, it is very difficult for it to die or have accidents, but we are eroding the land, especially my dear land, Jalisco. And there I also deal with agave-related companies that have little responsibility for the environment.

[sharkM 1]
But wait, wait.

[sharkM 1]
Why don't we give them a chance to answer us if they are doing something sustainable?

[sharkH 1]
That's what I was going to say. Let's see, tell me if there is something that can attract my attention to be with you and also talk about what I'm seeing.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Yes, for example, we are obviously aware, for example, using products that are not agrochemicals, but are, for example, bio-natural or microorganisms that can do something similar to what a chemist could do on the ground or on the ground. Obviously, we respect the Arab normativity and also the non-deforestation of what is the value chain for agave.

[sharkH 1]
You are telling me that they are bio-plantations, right? As it is known, bio-agriculture. Yes, sure, everything.

Because it is very complex.

[entrepreneurH 1]
We cannot say that it is 100% because we already have 550 hectares planted and it is difficult, but we are working on that part.

[entrepreneurM 1]
as much as possible. 

[sharkM 1]
If you manage to get Mauri to enter the deal, I'll put a million pesos in it, but I want 5%, hoping that Mauri gets the other million pesos for another 5%.

[sharkH 1]
I agree with Alejandra offer. I offer a million pesos for 5%, in co-offer with Mauri. And what about you, did you say?

[sharkH 5]
I was going to offer him about two million pesos, but for 10%. Maybe we could discuss a repurchase option in the future when I get to recover my two million pesos. We could put a repurchase of 5% on the table.

[entrepreneurH 1]
I wanted to make you a counteroffer.

[sharkM 5]
Let's see.

[entrepreneurH 1]
If you go with the same two million, one million and one million, for 6% in total.

[sharkM 5]
They already left Litchi out, right?

[sharkH 5]
Yes, they basically already left Litchi out.

[sharkH 2]
I'm out. No.

[sharkH 2]
Ale and I think we are willing to go down to 8%.  we can negotiate a repurchase.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Welcome.

[sharkM 2]
Do we have a deal? 

[entrepreneurM 1]
We have a deal.
