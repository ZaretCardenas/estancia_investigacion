I have a lot of work, I don't have time to take it to the workshop. It's good that there is Mobile Bike Service. Can you help me with the bike?

Of course. Hi sharks, nice to meet you, I'm Rogelio. I introduce you to my brother Omar, who is doing the mechanics at the moment.

Together we founded Mobile Bike Service, since we both enjoy the magnificent experiences that cycling gives us. However, there was one thing that we hated, and that was taking our bike to the workshop.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Mobile Bike Service came to innovate and evolve the way to repair your bike, since we are the only workshop and mobile store in Mexico that reaches the door of your house to offer preventive, corrective maintenance services, as well as the sale of parts and accessories. We have a fully equipped truck with a solar panel, green energy, which helps us supply all our electronic devices. In addition, with us you forget about traffic, since we reach the door of your house and in approximately 90 minutes you will have your bike ready and you will have the security and confidence that the service you paid for was carried out correctly, since if you like, we can do it in front of you.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Mobile Bike Service started operations on September 1, 2021, having great acceptance. A sample of this is that last year we reached a sale of 1,260,000 pesos with a utility before taxes of 677,000 pesos. We performed 1,037 services with a single truck.

However, our goal is to have at least three trucks in Mexico City and one in each state of the republic, since the market is very wide. That is why we are already preparing to be able to sell franchises in our business.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Today we are here looking for an investment of 399,000 pesos for 15% of the company. With the guarantee that we will return your investment in no more than two years, since we are willing to give up up to 50% of the company's net utilities.

[sharkH 2]
I want to understand, you are giving up shares of your company, but you also have a preferential return in which you are going to return the investment in two years and after two years we are still owners of 15%? 

[entrepreneurH 1]
That's right.

[sharkH 3]
Hey, are you sure you want to make that offer? 

entrepreneurH 1]
Yes, of course. 

[sharkH 3]
What are you going to do with those 400,000 pesos?

[entrepreneurH 1]
We are going to use them to acquire another unit, equip it. We would acquire the unit through a listing.

[sharkM 3]
Roger and Omar, how much does each bicycle service cost on average? What is the average ticket?

[entrepreneurH 1]
Our average ticket is 1,215 pesos. 

[sharkH 3]
How much of that is service and how much of that is refurbishment? 

[entrepreneurH 1]
Of our total sales, 87% is service and 13% is refurbishment.

[sharkH 3]
Let me tell you something.
I'm in. Me too. Relax, guys.

And the offer is then? My offer is to give you what you came to ask for, the 399,000 pesos for 15%, 50% of utilities until I recover my money and I stay with 15%. Well, it's fine, I also accept it.

[sharkH 3]
I also liked it, but I do want... I see this, we're going to take it to the next level, we're going to take this. You got excited, Lichi.

You got excited, but what kind of offer? Yes, what kind? Neither better nor worse.

Nothing, what you came to ask for. I mean, let me ask you a question. Yes.

Do you have two offers for what you came for? They have three. 

[sharkH 3]
Three offers.

[sharkH 3]
But I do want... I do want to take it to the next level. I'm worried about your business and I want to understand what it's about before throwing money at you.

[sharkM 3]
I mean, you don't, Lichi. You don't worry.

[sharkH 3]
I'm not worried. As soon as I saw them, I liked them very much. You can see they know what they're doing.

[sharkH 3]
The person who's going to drive the truck today is one of you two?

[entrepreneurH 1]
We have a mechanic. I'm in the operation part. I'm also involved in the services part.

However, we check with another mechanic too.

[sharkH 3]
I like that it's not you. Because that means you've already found a way to scale this.

[sharkM 3]
Rogelio and Omar, what is the level of income you can have if you take 100% of the capacity of one of the trucks?

[entrepreneurH 1]
We could do from four to six services in one day with one unit. However, right now our average of services is only three per day. On average, with those three services, we're making a sale of $105,000 per month.

[sharkM 3]
So if you get to 100% capacity, how much would your sale be?

[entrepreneurH 1]
We could sell 210,000 pesos.

[sharkM 3]
210,000 pesos. So right now, from the sales you had last year, which was 1.3 million pesos, you could really sell with this same unit, 2.6 million pesos.

[entrepreneurH 1]
It depends a lot, since we're a mobile workshop, on the location. Because here with the traffic and everything, it's complicated sometimes.

[sharkH 3]
What's the bottleneck to have more services? What's stopping you from having just one truck?

[sharkM 3]
Capacity. 

[entrepreneurH 1]
What's stopping us is that we want another unit, because we don't want to have the traditional workshops, which are very saturated, and then they're going to want to schedule. And we're going to tell them, you know what, in 15 days I can go to your house.

We, right now, haven't tried to scale the business more, because first we want to have another unit. And having the other unit, then yes, we give the next step.

[sharkH 3]
How do your people find out? They're asking us a lot of things, man.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Our growth has been organic. We haven't done any advertising.

[sharkH 3]
I want to know what you're looking for. You came here, you already have the whole panel excited. What are you looking for in a shark?

[entrepreneurH 1]
Obviously, the experience, your expertise. I mean, for me it's an honor to be here and to be able to swim with sharks one day.

[sharkH 3]
Then why don't you accept the offer? This offer is going to expire.

[entrepreneurH 1]
No, no, I mean, I mean...

[sharkH 3]
Don't put pressure on him. Don't put pressure on him. Are you waiting for someone to improve the offer?

[entrepreneurH 1]
If two of you joined and maybe instead of 399, it was 799, and we give up 15 and 15.

[sharkH 3]
I agree. I agree too. Are you willing to give up 30% of the company?

Here we are, Marcos and I, we're going to make that offer. You have three seconds to tell us if you want it or not.

[sharkH 3]
One. So you're doubling the offer. Two.

[entrepreneurH 1]
No, come on, let's go.
