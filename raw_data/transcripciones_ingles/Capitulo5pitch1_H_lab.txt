My name is Alexey, I'm a financial lawyer, and Adrian, our coach. We want to introduce you to Vivat. Vivat is born from the love and the concept of baseball.

Looking for a place where I could train without the need to be a baseball player, or train and have someone improve my batting skills, I realized that it doesn't exist, and that's where the idea came to mind. We developed the model, and today it's Vivat. Vivat is a brand that integrates its operating model with six business units, from which we receive income.

Today, we have a portfolio of 12,500 registered clients in our system, and more than 20,200 hours of service sold. That's why we're asking for an investment of 3 million pesos for 6% of the company. All our clients, or a large part of them, say that batting is easy.

[sharkM 2]
Thank you. What are the six business lines?

[entrepreneurH 1]
The first is our semi-professional baseball theme, where the development of our machines allows us to reach capacities up to 80-90 miles per hour, focused on a high professional level. The second model is the recreational theme. All our coaches are trained to teach and train.

The third model we have in operation is the rent of mobile cages. Our fourth model is the retail theme, where today we already have agreements signed with different exclusive baseball brands with a distribution exclusivity agreement in Mexico. Our fifth model is the development of baseball teams and our sixth model, the franchise theme.

Alexei, with all these business lines, tell us what have been the sales of the company in the last three years.

[entrepreneurH 1]
In the first fiscal year, we had sales of 2,551,000 pesos. For our second year, we had sales of 8,831,000 pesos. For our third year, which is 2023, we already have an estimated projection of 19 million pesos.

[sharkH 2]
Hey, Alexei, how much has the company invested? 

[entrepreneurH 1]
In total, we have invested approximately 6 million pesos in the brand.

[sharkH 2]
Hey, Alexei, what are you looking for in the tank? What partner are you looking for?

[entrepreneurH 1]
Yes, we want the 3 million pesos for the development and improvement of our machines, which, although they are quite complete, we also want to start having a line of machines that we can export.

[sharkM 2]
And what is your gross margin? Gross?

[entrepreneurH 1]
We have a margin of approximately 60%.

[sharkM 2]
Gross?

[sharkH 2]
Yes. Net? About 40%.

[sharkM 2]
Wow. How much did you earn last year?

[entrepreneurH 1]
Last year it was around 5 million pesos.

[sharkM 2]
Wow. That's a lot of money. 

[sharkH 2]
Alexei, I'm going to make you an offer. And I'm going to pull Lichi if she's interested in the offer.

[sharkH 2]
Let's see, I was also going to make you one to see which one is better, because I liked it.

[sharkH 2]
Let's see if Lichi likes it. I offer 1.5 million pesos for 5% and I leave space for Lichi to also put the other half and together we make 10% of the offer.

[sharkH 2]
Can I add something? Go ahead. I would add 2% of the sale until we recover those 3 million pesos.

[sharkM 2]
Can I say something? I like your valuation, because it is 6 times gross utility, 10 times net utility, which is more or less what is expected of this type of business. And I can help with all the digital marketing and I would like to enter with 1 million.

So if you want one, one and one, if you accept me.

[sharkH 2]
Do you want to go ahead? Yes, I agree.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Okay, Marisa.

[sharkM 2]
For me it is not a topic that I am so passionate about and above all I think you have a very good offer that I could hardly improve and for that reason I am out. Thank you, Marisa.

[sharkM 2]
Alexei, I think you have a great offer. It is a very cool model, I hope you continue to grow a lot.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Thank you.

[sharkM 2]
I'm not going to make you an offer, I'm out.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Okay, thank you. 

[sharkH 2]
I'm going to repeat the offer to help you also think, Alexei. Okay, okay, okay, okay.

We are 3 Sharks. Each one enters with 1 million pesos. We distribute 10% among 3 people, but we also propose that 2% of the sales go to us to recover the investment and once we recover the investment we return that 2% of the sales.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Well, we're in.

[sharkM 2]
Do we have a deal?

[entrepreneurH 1]
Yes, we have a deal.
