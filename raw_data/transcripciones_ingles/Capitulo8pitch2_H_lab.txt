Hello, sharks. I started kayaking several years ago, and it became my passion. The place where I practiced was Xochimilco, and I thought it was the perfect place to start this business.

[sharkM 5]
You didn't tell us your name.

[entrepreneurH 2]
Adalberto Garc√≠a de Mendoza. Kayak 33 offers guided tours. The highlight of the place is the sunrise.
Annually, sales are around one million pesos, with a margin of 50%. The reason why I'm here and I want to invite you to participate is the expansion of Kayak 33. At five years, I intend to open five branches, one per year, and later, if everything goes well, at ten years, think about franchises.
For now, what I need to achieve this is 200,000 pesos in exchange for 20% of the company. So, sharks, if you're ready to go hunting and party, come kayaking with me. 

[sharkM 5]
Perfect, Alberto, and why 33?

[entrepreneurH 2]
It's a number that defines me. Every time I see a 33 anywhere, that 33 tells me that I'm on the right track.

[sharkH 5]
So, what advantage would you offer me if I had a Kayak 33 franchise?

[entrepreneurH 2]
Unlike other Kayak services, they don't share the same passion as I do for kayaking. By making a franchise, we can position this idea of how to do kayaking correctly.

[sharkH 5]
Give me an example of a Kayak knowledge that someone else would not know.

[entrepreneurH 2]
For example, the one who does the direction of the kayak has to go in the back, because of the weight, the design of the boat, the kayaks tend to turn right, to the wind, and all that kind of knowledge in the traditional Kayak tours is not given. But since I'm passionate about kayaking, I intend to teach everything I know, because my hope is that the community of kayakers in the country grows.

[sharkH 5]
My question is, of those tours that you do, how many people go to the tour, and how do they get to you? How do you get clients to be part of the tours that you have?

[entrepreneurH 2]
The advertising has been organic. The people are the ones who have really recommended me.

[sharkM 5]
Alberto, there are other Kayak companies that give tours in Xochimilco?

[entrepreneurH 2]
Yes, there are about 4 or 5 companies.

[sharkM 5]
And tell us a little bit about how your business works. Do you have to pay for something in the park? Do you have to get permission, or can anyone come with their kayaks and start working?

[entrepreneurH 2]
The answer is, yes. If you have your kayak and you arrive, you get into the channels and navigate. 

[sharkM 5]
There is no restriction?

[entrepreneurH 2]
There is no restriction to navigate. 

[sharkM 5]
But to start a business, do you have to pay something to the park to start a business there? 

[entrepreneurH 2]
Currently, I work hand in hand with a person who has a piece of land and who charges me a certain amount for each person I bring in.

[sharkM 5]
Alberto, I'm sorry to tell you this, but this business has no entry barriers and it is very difficult to climb. It's a cool business, a lifestyle business, a business that will give you to live and that will give you to work, but it's not an invertible business. Think very well about your business model and if you really want it, and you can grow.
I'm out.

[sharkH 5]
I'm going to defend you a little bit, because you could do that with all the tour companies, right? And there are very large tour companies, so why do they grow?

[sharkM 5]
Because they have a methodology. For example, diving schools have become so relevant that you can't dive anywhere, in many places, if you don't have that certification.

[sharkH 5]
Yes, but you are saying something very specific, right? That's why. But you are looking for an experience.I went to Xochimilco recently, for the first time, and in fact, I would go back to the same because it was more the experience.

[sharkM 5]
Are you going to make them an offer?

[sharkH 5]
You can dive if you have a vision, right? 

[sharkH 5]
Adam, while the two sharks are talking, let me ask you a question. How many kayaks do you need to come to a branch?

[entrepreneurH 2]
No more than five double kayaks. 

[sharkH 5]
And how much does a kayak cost?

[entrepreneurH 2]
One like this has a value at this time of 30,000 pesos.

[sharkH 5]
So really the money for a branch would be to buy kayaks. 

[entrepreneurH 2]
Sure.That's why the investment is so low.

[sharkH 5]
Service and marketing.

[sharkH 5]
The only thing you have told us is that the business depends a lot on you. Have you thought about virtual branches? Is it a methodology that you may not have developed yet?
Then another idea that came to me is to offer these activities to the hotels. But I do feel that you came to the tank with few elements so that investors would be attracted to your business model. And for those reasons, I am out.

[sharkM 5]
I agree with what Mauri said and with what Alejandra said. I don't see a replicated business structure that I would be interested in investing in. And apart from the franchise, I see it as deeply risky.And for those reasons, I am out.

[sharkH 5]
Alberto, it shows that you love the topic here and that will probably happen to your clients. They will not see that with you. I am going to make you an offer.

I am going to lend you money. I know that in Mexico it is very complicated to deal with banks. With me, it will be very easy.

You are going to pay me back with the income you generate with your expansion and everything at a rate of 15%. I am not going to take any equity. It is something that will facilitate your growth.

That would be my offer.

[entrepreneurH 2]
Sounds good. We already have a credit offer.

[sharkH 5]
I have a question about your growth. Last year, in 2022, how much did you sell?

[entrepreneurH 2]
Less than 800. The reality is that the important growth happened just at the end of the pandemic and everyone wanted to leave.

[entrepreneurH 2]
In 2022? That's right. 

[sharkH 5]
But you don't sell a million, you sell 800.
They already told you a lot of things. Risk, franchise, model, scalability, etc. I am out.

[sharkH 5]
Anyway, as Ale said, it is a lifestyle business and to be honest, why sell a part of the company? You have the vision of what you want to do, but if I have money and you don't need it.

[sharkH 5]
Do we have a deal? 

[entrepreneurH 2]
Yes, we have a deal. Thank you and I also look forward to your experience with me.

[sharkH 5]
Thank you.
