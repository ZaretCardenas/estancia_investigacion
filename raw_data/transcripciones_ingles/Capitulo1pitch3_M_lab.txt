I'm Daniela Mu√±oz, director and founder of Transalud. 

[sharkM 5]
What is Transalud? 

[entrepreneurH 2]
It's not just a clinic.

It's not a company. It's not a brand. It's, first of all, a cause of life.

Literally. It's a struggle. Of course, we're also a company.

A virtual clinic for the whole trans community. Where is Transalud born? A pandemic was born.

No one had access to health in a pandemic. So, using our privileges, the people who have a career, who are from the trans community, we started to give financial consultations. The consultations normally cost 1,200 in Transalud.

And they start at 280. From there, what each patient wants to pay is free. What is the average of what each patient pays?

A large, large average? 425 pesos. We thought this was going to be like something philanthropic in the meantime.

No, man. It grew tremendously. From 2021 to now, we already have 1,080 patients.

How much do we invest in marketing? Zero. Literally, word for word.

We also have, obviously, access to face-to-face private care in Monterrey, Guanajuato and Mexico City. Because we have alliances. We also have laboratories.

We have Transpharma, which is the first pharmaceutical company specialized in trans health. And the new one, which is Transversidad, which is the first trans university. As I told you, it's not just a clinic.

It's about giving access to what we had historically been taken away from us. And what have they taken from us? Literally everything.

Access to everything. Transalud is, more than anything, a cause that we are trying to achieve. Precisely a world more equal to the one they gave us.

In the first year, we had some net utilities. From 1,300 to 1,800. In the second and third year, 2,200.

And from the third and fourth year, which is precisely for the investment that we are going to request, we are going to introduce two things that the trans community needs. Access to economic laser therapy and for operating rooms. Exclusive operating rooms for trans health.

We are going to ask for two modalities. One modality is 10% for 4 million. The valuation cap is obviously at 2,026.

As I mentioned, the sum is 41 million in utility. And the other is 4 million in loans. In return for investment for four years as well.

[sharkH 5]
To get the valuation, did you decide to add the utilities for the next few years? Correct.

[sharkM 5]
I want to understand the valuation a little more. Although you told us that it is to add all the utilities. It's like I didn't get the math.

[entrepreneurM 2]
As I told you, the first year was 1,300. The second year was 1,600. And right from 2023, which is the third year, with the growth of surgeries, which is what is giving a huge revenue, at least four are already expected.

And the interesting thing here is that the laser will leave per year, the revenue of the laser is two, increasing, increasing year by year. And the net earnings of a operating room, of what a surgery costs, is 22%. So this increases us another 2 million per year.

So by 2026, the sum of the flow is 40.

[sharkH 5]
Let me tell you something about this. You forgot a factor, which is the discount for future risk. In other words, a utility in 2026 is not worth the same as a utility today.

You missed that factor and I think you are overvalued for that.

[entrepreneurM 2]
Of course, it will not be the same because of the risk. Without a doubt, the growth of the community is also huge. And obviously, this impacts the numbers.

As I told you, this growth that I gave you, this projection is organic, as we have had it right now. Of course, we are going to start advertising gradually, and this is going to explode. If not, it has already exploded.

[sharkM 5]
Daniela, within the virtual clinic that you have, I imagine that the psychological part is something that you also attend a lot, or do you only dedicate yourselves to the physical part? No, it's an incredible question.

[entrepreneurM 2]
Because I started alone, right? Well, hey doctor, can you give me a consultation? Of course, right?

And alone came treaters who are also trans. This is key. All the people who are working in Transalud are trans.

Why? Because we are also giving access, as I told you, to work. So today we are already more than 16 specialists.

[sharkH 5]
Daniela, I want to understand the problem a little bit.
For example, you talk about laboratories. Why would laboratory exams be with you?

[entrepreneurM 2]
Because if you go to this other company, they marginalize you, they discriminate you. And also, if you go to a person who is non-binary, by force it is a man or a woman. And here in Translabs, we already have non-binary people.

[sharkH 5]
Let's say it's a matter of discrimination and also a matter of accessibility in cost. Totally. I mean, discrimination is what hurts the most, but what makes access to us the most impossible is the cost.

[entrepreneurM 2]
When I tell you, patients tell me, Doctor, I saved three months for your consultation of 280 and very happy. I mean, that hurts me. And I was at that moment.

I emphasize that. It's not about making money. Of course we are going to win it.

And we are winning it. It's about changing lives. My community.

Because they all had no access to anything. And the stories of each patient are very hard. They are also part of my story.

Because what hurts, I also hurt it. That's why I'm giving the time of my life to a cause.

[sharkH 5]
Can you explain a little more about that virtual part? So you don't have to go to a specific site, it's on the Internet. And that model is growing a lot.

Tell us a little more about the process, of what the client experience would be like.

[entrepreneurM 2]
It's great because the pandemic made the needs worse. And that makes us have a lot of creativity. How do we solve it?

With the streaming services that are there. And how do we do the payment? They go to the Transalud page.

They see the profile of each specialist. They click on the specialist's profile. And it opens the payment page.

You get all the prices. You decide to pay 500 pesos. The payment screen appears on the platform.

And at the end, a company league sends you, which automatically schedules everything. And that's how simple it is.

[sharkM 5]
Daniela, I want to congratulate you. Your story inspires me. It excites me.
The push, the dedication. I think that nowadays, we need conviction in the new generations. And if we had more agents of change, I think you are an important agent of change for a country that still has a lot to improve on deeply rooted issues that are hurting us a lot.

And for me, you deserve a congratulations. Thank you. The truth is that clinics are not a place where I have knowledge.
Therefore, I am out. But I offer you help in nutrition. With great pleasure, I offer you that help.

[entrepreneurM 2]
Thank you.

[sharkH 5]
Daniela, I love your courage to defend something that you believe in, to defend a community, to do what you are doing, to build it. The problem I have is that I don't know anything about medical clinics or how to grow it. I mean, my contribution would be purely economic.

And that's something I normally don't like. Because I prefer to provide knowledge, contacts that I think have an even more important value than money. And in this case, I can't do it.

And that's why I'm out. Okay, thank you.

[sharkM 5]
In our company, we are deeply inclusive. I want to congratulate you. I love what you are doing.

It seems to me that it is a problem that is very little addressed, especially from the inside. And all of us out there can judge, or we can feel or hear what you may need. But no one can know it better than you.

No one can know better than you what you have suffered. So I love that your entire team are people like you, trans people. And what they are looking for is to support others.

Go for it with Daniela. It's a topic that I think is very important. It's the same as them.

I have no experience in this, to be able to support you. But I would like to support you in another way. I would love to interview you on the podcast.

Thank you. Everyone, I'm out.

[sharkM 5]
Daniela, I loved the pricing model you have. The pricing model. I think this is something great, that will be very successful.

And in the end, you are supporting the community, but you are also doing something for your business. But you made a mistake in one thing, in the valuation. And that's what doesn't allow me to make an investment with you.

With great pleasure, I help you to get the loan, because I don't lend money.

[sharkM 5]
What you you think about lending the money

[sharkM 5]
And also... Normally, I don't lend money.
I'm not a financial company. And I don't do that. I could...
I'm part of the gay community. And I would be very happy to join you to tackle this problem.

[sharkM 5]
Right? What do you think, Brian? Do you support us?

[sharkH 5]
I was going to be out, but the idea you mentioned, I would be willing to participate as a loan. So, if you want to set up this loan, we have to talk about the rate and how it would be. I don't know what you think about that.

[sharkM 5]
Why don't we do this? We lend you the 4 million pesos, between Mauri, Marisa, Brian and me, at a rate of 15% per year, and with a return of our loan at 4 years, as you asked. What do you think?

Do we have a deal?

[entrepreneurH 2]
We have a deal.
