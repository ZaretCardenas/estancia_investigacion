Hello, my name is Naomi.

[entrepreneurH 1]
My name is Cuauhtli, and we are co-founders of Menulocal, a startup in Patia.

[entrepreneurM 1]
Menulocal is the first gastronomic social network that enables the trade of these gastronomic entrepreneurs in Mexico and Latin America, giving them the digital tools they need to grow their business. With Menulocal, all these entrepreneurs can request deliveries to send their products, they can have their store online, and it is also a super easy and simple tool so that they can manage their stores, shipments, orders, everything from their cell phone.

[entrepreneurM 1]
Surely we all know some business of this type, which are street stalls, which are entrepreneurs who sell their food on social networks, or who go to the offices to offer their food. All these gastronomic entrepreneurs represent 60% of the food economy in Latin America. In Mexico City alone, there are more than 350,000 businesses of this type, and they cannot enter platforms because they do not operate as restaurants.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Our business model is simple. We charge a monthly membership to the food provider, and we launched three months ago. We already have more than 100 micro-businesses offering their products in the city of Guadalajara.

That is why we are requesting 3 million pesos for 7% in a safe.

[sharkH 5]
I know a business called Menulocal in Guadalajara. Is it the same?

[entrepreneurH 1]
We acquired the brand at the beginning of last year.

[sharkM 5]
How much did the brand cost you?

[entrepreneurH 1]
It cost us a debt of a million pesos, which we have already paid. Have you already paid the million pesos? Yes, we have already paid it.

[sharkH 5]
I have terrible news for you. Menulocal did a terrible job. It was a brutal fraud for its investors.

The brand is good, but the work they did was disastrous.

[entrepreneurM 1]
Yes, I agree with that.

[sharkH 5]
I want to clarify some details here, because I heard many things. Do they have social networks? Do they have transactional websites?

What else do you do?

[entrepreneurM 1]
The platform is made up of three main sections. One of them is the marketplace. The other part of the platform is the social part, where businesses can upload publications.

And the third is that within the platform, they also have SaaS tools, such as requesting a distributor, opening their online store, making their QR menu.

[sharkH 5]
You are trying to boil the ocean with this. It is impossible to make social media, social networks, online store, marketplace, social community, SaaS tools. As an entrepreneur, you have to have a focus.

If I were the CEO of the company, I think I would have to reduce the focus a bit. You have to understand what the real problem is that you are solving. You can't solve all the problems that exist for companies.

[entrepreneurM 1]
We are not focused on the consumer restaurant market. Our local menu motive is to support those creators who start at home and say, I know how to make delicious cookies. I'm going to sell them with my friends, with my family.

And you know they're delicious. People start buying from you.

[entrepreneurM 1]
And 60% of our food creators are women.

[sharkM 5]
I understand where you're going, but really, this differentiator that you promise, I don't know if it has value. In the other platforms, you can also enter and set your schedule of when you want to produce. And it's not just restaurants.

You can find everything. There are little shops, there are stalls, there is absolutely all that. I don't see that as a differentiator.

[sharkM 5]
I don't know if I understood you, maybe I can finish seeing the differentiator. The big advantage that these entrepreneurs who are at home making cookies have, if they get on a platform like these giants, the percentage they ask you to buy is very high. Another thing that I would sell them is that they are supporting women a lot, which I am passionate about and we agree on that.

[sharkM 5]
Yes, it's okay as long as they are helping you sell.

[sharkH 5]
But in terms of business, for the reasons I mentioned, the lack of focus, the challenge to control the demand, I'm out.


[sharkM 5]
How do you make money? Only from membership sales?

[entrepreneurM 1]
Yes, it’s the only way we’re earning money. We need 250 active, recurring businesses paying the membership to break even.

[sharkM 5]
How much do you charge for the monthly membership?

[entrepreneurM 1]
We charge between 399 pesos and 1500 pesos per month.

But with that, you'd have sales of, say, if I take 1000 pesos on average per membership, you'd have an income of 250 thousand pesos per month, approximately 3 million pesos annually, and the company is worth 43 million pesos?

[sharkM 5]
Your valuation is ridiculous
I don't know how long they think they'll get to 5,000, but even at 5,000, they don't get to the valuation you are planning for that reason I am out .

[Orador 5]
I don't see how they're going to sell what you need to sell. That's why I'm out.

[sharkH 5]
The valuation threw me off from the start. I didn’t see anything that screamed differentiation yet. Maybe you have it, but I didn’t see it. For me, this SaaS configuration and these startup models feel very impersonal. I don’t see myself working with you on something like this. I prefer more personal businesses, I like to get involved with entrepreneurs from the beginning, and for those reasons, I’m out.

[sharkM 5]
I put myself in the shoes of those women entrepreneurs, and that part won me over. I really like the fact that you have this social idea present from the beginning. However, rebuilding a burnt brand is extremely difficult, and the valuation is extremely high, especially given a tough reality to achieve. For those reasons, I’m out.

[entrepreneurM 1]
Thank you.
