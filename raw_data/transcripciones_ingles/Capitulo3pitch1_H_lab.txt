Hello, sharks. I'm Osama Asif, co-founder of PAN. I'm very excited to introduce you to our company, PAN.

Bread is part of the culture of our country. Who doesn't want to eat freshly baked bread from their favorite bakery? It's the glory of the morning.

The bakery is the center of every community in the Republic. In fact, the bakeries are the third largest employer in Mexico. However, today, the bakeries in Mexico suffer.

They have difficulty finding the ingredients, especially with a high price. They don't have solutions to manage the inventory. That's why we created PAN, a platform of B2B technology to order and manage the inventory of bakeries.

In almost a year and a half, we have sales of 10 million pesos with a 12% utility margin. That's why we're asking for $50,000 per 1% in our business. Let's support bakeries together.

Where are you from, Osama?

[entrepreneurH 1]
I was born in Los Angeles, but my parents were from Pakistan.

[sharkM 4]
Why did you decide to enter this business? Where did the idea come from? Let's talk a little.

[entrepreneurH 1]
I would like to say that after years involved in the problems of the supply chain, we saw that bakeries are the most underserved market in Mexico. In Mexico City alone, there are 40,000 bakeries with a value of $1.2 billion in just buying ingredients.

[sharkM 3]
Osama, who are you doing this business with?

[entrepreneurH 1]
I would like to talk about our founder, Veridiana Su√°rez Azcobar. She is a crack. She has 20 years of experience in the supply chain in Central de Abastos.

[sharkM 4]
And what about you? 

[entrepreneurH 1]
I started in technology in Mexico four years ago. I was responsible for the growth of one of the most downloaded online shopping apps in Mexico.

[sharkM 4]
Explain to us how you monetize, because it's not very clear to me. Who do you charge? The provider of raw material to get customers?To the bakers to get good raw material at a good price?

[entrepreneurH 1]
We still don't have a B2B SaaS fee that we are charging. We only charge our bakers when they buy our products.

[sharkM 2]
They are a distributor. Ah, it's in the raw material. Do you deliver?

Are you owners of the delivery fleet?

[entrepreneurH 6]
Yes. 

[sharkH 2]
Do you have a logistics center? Do you move the goods?
Do you receive the goods and send them?

[entrepreneurH 1]
Our goal is to have the minimum, the minimum supply we need. So the way we operate is that we don't buy before we have the order. And for your question, please.

We carry all orders through our trucks.

[sharkM 2]
How many trucks do you have?

[entrepreneurH 1]
We only have two.

[sharkH 5]
You have, if I understand correctly, 10 million pesos for sale, which is the purchase of the product and the sale of the product. And more or less 1.2 million pesos of utility for that purchase and sale. However, your company is worth 92 million pesos.Why?

[entrepreneurH 1]
Well, three points. One is that we have an excellent team. At the same time, the size of the market, which is 40,000 bakeries in Mexico City.And finally, the attraction we had.

[sharkM 4]
Your idea seems to me to be a very good idea. It seems to me to be a great support for the PYMES. 

[sharkH 4]
Are you going to enter, Marisa?

[sharkM 4]
To that assessment? I'm out for the assessment. Thank you very much.

[sharkM 2]
What is the growth month over month?

[entrepreneurH 1]
I can say that year by year we had 86% growth.

[sharkH 6]
Well, Carla brings you an offer because she really likes these companies. Let me tell you, very bluntly, I think the assessment is crazy. I wish you success.
I'm out. 

[entrepreneurH 1]
Thank you very much.

[sharkM 3]
In the end, this is a logistics company to a very fragmented market. To meet all these needs and really scale the business, basically what you're going to have to do is have a very large logistics arm with very small margins.

[entrepreneurH 1]
But what we see in the bakery market, the profit is much higher.

[sharkM 3]
Yes or no? 

[sharkM 4]
No, I'm going to wait for you to decide.

[sharkM 2]
Let's see. I really like what you're doing. In my opinion, it has the potential to be a unicorn and reach a valuation of a thousand million dollars.

The valuation is very expensive. It is almost four times more expensive. But I would die of anger if in five years I see that you are being invested in large funds and that I had you here and I did not invest you.

I want to make you an offer for a million pesos, but for 3.5% of the company and a seat in the board and certain provisions of non-dilution.

[sharkM 4]
Non-dilution?

[sharkM 2]
Sure. The problem with entering so early is that when a big shark arrives, like an investment fund that is going to invest 100 million dollars, which is what it will need to enter, they grab the little ones and put them aside. And then, instead of winning 100x what you invested, you end up winning 3x.

So it is important that they cannot dilute you so easily. And also, with 1, 2, 3, even 5%, in real life you have zero decision power and even zero ability to ask for information. And I talk to him tomorrow, I tell him, hey, how are your sales going?

He can tell me, sorry, you have 5%, you do not have the right to have information. So it is important that even if it is a small percentage, I can know that it is a huge investment for me, and then I can sit at the table and listen to how the decisions are made and have a vote. Thank you.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Thank you very much for the offer. I would like to ask you something. We have not yet had or opened our investment round.

Can you help us in fundraising and launch our pre-seed round?

[sharkM 2]
Of course. I think the value of an investor at this early stage is that I can open a door for you. So this counts on me because it would also be in my best interest.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Can you give me a second to confirm and have the feedback from Viridiana?

[sharkM 2]
Of course.

[sharkM 4]
Osama, do you have an answer?

[entrepreneurH 1]
Well, thank you very much for the offer. I would like to ask for a million pesos in a form of credit line to return to you after a year and lower what you are looking for by 2%.

[sharkM 3]
Osama, with that offer, Marcus and I would be in. Well, yes, but it doesn't bring anything. I'm sorry.We have a lot of experience in raising capital. Wait.

[sharkM 2]
And why do we need them?

[sharkM 5]
Imagine how the advice accounts are put together.

[sharkH 3]
I just want you to understand. 

[sharkM 3]
Take Marcus and me.

[shark M2]
You have a deal with me, but now you have to say it.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Very fast. 3% each. 500, 500, 500.

To return you 1.5 million pesos after a year for 3%. 1%, 1%, 1%. I agree.

[sharkH 3]
I'm in.

[sharkM 2]
I mean, if it's the only way to make the deal. She doesn't want us in. But I want the advice seat for me.

[sharkH 5]
I have no problem with Carla Stenson having the advice seat.

[sharkM 3]
Ale, neither do I. I agree. I'm in.

[sharkH 5]
Do we have a deal?

[entrepreneurH 1]
We have a deal. Great.
