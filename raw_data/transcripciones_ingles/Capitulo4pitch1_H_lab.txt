My name is Jorge Vallarta. And my name is Rodrigo Marcos. And we are Groovy Cereal.

The best option for a healthy cereal made with quinoa, for children and the whole family, without added sugar and with a unique flavor.

[entrepreneurH 1]
For years, the cereals that our mothers gave us for lack of options were this. Pure sugar! And on the other hand, the healthy alternatives offer us this.

Many times, these cereals are not healthy. They can be insipid, expensive, and worst of all, cereals that have not been focused on children, making Mexico the number one country in the world with infant obesity.

[entrepreneurH 1]
And that is precisely why we create Groovy, where we are combining the flavor of a traditional cereal with the ingredients of a healthy cereal. 100% free of seeds, without added sugar, low in calories, high in fiber, gluten-free, 100% vegan and 100% Mexican. We notice that the vast majority of healthy cereals are focused on adults, but there are very few focused on children.

[entrepreneurH 1]
In 2022, being our first year of sales, we managed to be in 16 states of the republic, in more than 120 points of sale, in two regional chains. We also make 30% of our online sales, mainly through marketplaces and our website. Figures!

We are here asking for an investment of 1.2 million pesos in exchange for 10% of Groovy. Here we have our two flavors. It's Cocoa Groovy, which is chocolate.

All the ingredients are planted in Mexico and we also have a more neutral flavor, which is Frosted Vanilla.

[sharkH 5]
You didn't say the amount of sales in 2022.

[entrepreneurH 1]
In 2022, we sold almost 2 million pesos.

[sharkM 3]
How do you produce it and what ingredients do you use?

[entrepreneurH 1]
The base is made of corn and quinoa.

We only use eight ingredients, all high quality. If you try it, it doesn't taste as simple because we use cellulose. It's a simple sugar that the body can't digest, so it doesn't provide calories, but the most important thing is that it doesn't raise the glucose levels in the blood.

[sharkM 3]
Do you produce it? Do you have a machine? 

[entrepreneurH 1]
Yes.

[sharkM 3]
Did you develop the recipe and pass it to someone who makes it?

[entrepreneurH 1]
We make it in Monterrey. 

[sharkH 3]
What do you want to achieve? For a giant cereal company to arrive in 10 years and buy you?

What do you see in the future?

[entrepreneurH 1]
We want to have two points of market participation And what's the goal? The goal is to grow the brand. We're not wrong.

If big companies arrive in five years because you've already made noise and want to buy us, we're not wrong about that.

[sharkH 3]
You're not disagree. 

[entrepreneurH 1]
I do not disagree .

[sharkM 3]
How much do you sell the cereal box for? What is the public price? And how much do you earn from each box?

[entrepreneurH 1]
The cereal box, in the end, is at 89 pesos. 

[sharkM 3]
How much does it cost? 

[entrepreneurH 1]
45.8 pesos the box. 

[sharkH 3]
And you sell it twice, but the double is what's left of the retailer.

[entrepreneurH 1]
No, no, no.
Our services are sold at 71.5 and the final price is 89.

[sharkM 3]
How much does a regular box of cereal that only has sugar cost?

[entrepreneurH 1]
There are some that can be 60 pesos, there are others that can be more expensive than ours, and so you go to the healthy ones and they're between 150 and 200 pesos.

[sharkM 3]
So you're almost half the price of your healthy competition.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Yes

[sharkH 3]
but that's not the competition. You have to compare it with... The habit doesn't change.

So you just have to replace the product with the ones full of sugar.

[sharkM 3]
Let's see if I understand. What you're saying is that the competition isn't the super healthy ones, but the ones full of sugar.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Of course. Make it easy. Because then, it's useless to give you the best, healthiest cereal in the world, but you're going to give it to someone who can't eat it.

[sharkM 3]
Is this the box for sale to the public?

[entrepreneurH 1]
Correct.

[sharkM 3]
It doesn't have a seal?

[entrepreneurH 1]
No.

[sharkH 3]
How much do you plan to sell this year? 

[entrepreneurH 1]
This year, we're between 8 and 10 million pesos.

[sharkH 3]
What's your production capacity? 

[entrepreneurH 1]
20 tons, right now.

[sharkH 3]
Have you thought about putting your own plant to do this?

[entrepreneurH 1]
Yes, once we have the necessary volume, we'd like to have better control and a better market.

[sharkH 3]
Do you have enough, or how are you planning your work capital cycle to be able to finance the days of payment you're being asked for?

[entrepreneurH 1]
Right now, with the supermarkets, we have approved invoicing, and the rate is very friendly. We need the investment for work capital, to invest in purchasing organs, advertising in stores, and, in addition, it's the flavors. We want to bring out two more flavors this year.

That's why we're increasing the volume.

[entrepreneurH 1]
That's also going to help us reach the sales goal that we're looking for.

[sharkH 3]
Do you have a partnership? Are you two major partners? Or do you have a partner?

[entrepreneurH 1]
We're 50-50. 

[sharkH 3]
I'm going to tell you what worries me. 

[entrepreneurH 1]
Yes 

[sharkH 3]
I think it's going to be very difficult.

I mean, fighting against the big corporations is going to be complicated. I think the brand can improve, and they're going to require a lot of capital or a lot of financial discipline. Maybe not capital, but a lot of financial discipline.

So I'm going to make you an offer. And it's a consensual offer, here with Amaury and Ale, in which we're going to offer you not 1.2 million pesos, but we're going to give you 1.5 million pesos. But for 20% of the company.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Thank you very much. Thank you. 

[sharkH 3]
Are you open to receiving advice on how we can improve the position?

[entrepreneurH 1]
I think the most important thing is to have a big ear to listen to all the possible feedback and see what can be improved.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Can I ask you three a question? 

[entrepreneurH 1]
What else would you be willing to... 

[sharkH 3]
I'm going to answer that question and what we're going to offer Marcos and me. Ha, ha, ha.
Plus 2% of sales. A royalty of 2%. And in addition to this, we would add to the table a credit for the installation of a plant.

[sharkM 3]
We also put the credit.

[sharkH 3]
Oh, oh, oh. Don't copy me.

[sharkM 3]
No, yes. Groobies, I have a portfolio of delicious but healthy brands. It's part of my philosophy and it's part of my investment methodology.

I know perfectly well what the distribution channels are, the stores in which they have to be. I can also contribute a lot to the branding part. I give the floor to you.

[sharkH 3]
Having this team with the same mentality and the same philosophy of life which is what Ale said, is going to be key for your product.

[sharkH 3]
I'm excited about these projects. They excite me. What do I offer them?

Well, I offer them all the knowledge we have about nutrition, which is a lot. I'm also about to build a new plant. We're also very fresh in how to raise a plant from scratch.

And the truth is that this is my daily cereal. I mean, with that...

[sharkH 3]
Listen, I don't want to spend a lot of time, but I offer you not to talk so much, all the other sharks. Listen to you. To know what you need and support you in what you need.

[entrepreneurH 1]
I think your offer is very good, but we'd like to make a 15% discount for the 1.5. And also, in the future, when it's necessary, to have the possibility of a credit for the plant.

[sharkH 3]
I propose something. Why don't we raise it to 17% instead of 15%? 

[sharkH 3]
So they can split in three, or what?

Okay. Here we are centavers. You have to take care of the centavers, you can't take care of them alone.

And, obviously, the credit is on the table. Credit, no problem.

[sharkM 3]
So?

[sharkH 3]
Do we have a deal?

[entrepreneurH 1]
We have a deal. Welcome to La Grubita.
