My name is Jim Cervantes.

[entrepreneurH 1]
And I am Jesus Guzman. And together we created Pizzana. Pizzana was born during the pandemic.

When we met at home, where most of the fast food we ordered at home was full of empty calories and very processed ingredients.

[entrepreneurH 1]
My nutritionist always told me, Hey Jim, if you are going to go on a diet, never eat pizza, because it is one of the most caloric elements and with less nutrients. The cheeses are artificial, the meat has preservatives, it is full of refined flour, and the sauce always has sugar. That's why we created Pizzana.

A delicious pizza that you can customize according to your lifestyle. With natural ingredients at its base, such as cauliflower, oats, almonds, flaxseed, natural tomato sauce that we make daily in our supermarkets, mozzarella cheese, 100% milk, and exquisite combinations that adapt to your diet, either keto, low-carb, vegan, or simply because you crave it and you don't want guilt.

Today we are located in Guadalajara. We have two physical branches where we operate mostly in delivery, through pick-up or food apps. We also sell our pre-packed bases to the vacuum in specialized stores and we participate in events and festivals where it has been a total success.

[entrepreneurH 1]
What do you think about starting with 1.5 million for 20% of the company's share?

[sharkH 5]
Let's try it first.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Go ahead. 

[sharkH 5]
How much have you sell?

[entrepreneurH 1]
The first year we sold 100,000 pesos, which was in a few months. The second year we sold 2 million pesos.
Last year we sold 2.6 million and our forecast is that this year we will close at 3.3 million.

[sharkH 5]
How many assets do you have and how much have you invested in the business?

[entrepreneurH 1]
The initial investment of Pizzana was 600,000 pesos, which was made two and a half years ago, just when the pandemic started.

[sharkM 5]
You have three business lines. Restaurants, events, and the sale of products in specialized stores. How do you divide the income in these three lines?

[entrepreneurH 1]
85% right now is in stores, 5% is the base, which we have very little distribution, and the rest is festivals.

[sharkM 5]
And what is your operating cost?

[entrepreneurH 1]
Our operating cost is 35%. This year we estimate to lower it to 25%. 

[sharkM 5]
How?

[entrepreneurH 1]
Because we are not using our capacity in stores. We are at 21% or 100%. The festivals brought us proof of how much we can also produce in one day.
We want to produce more with the same machinery we have in order to lower the cost.

[sharkH 5]
Do you have the same service as a pizzeria? Can you call by phone, order your pizza and they deliver it to you?

[entrepreneurH 1]
We use a lot of pick-ups. Most people like to go there because we are still a destination. But we have applications, which have a higher commission, and we are going to incorporate Last Mile this year, which are these intermediaries that will help us.


[sharkH 5]
Very important. What kind of shark are you looking for?

[entrepreneurH 1]
We are totally looking for smart money, because we can look for a million and a half.

[sharkM 5]
We are all smart money here, don't worry.

[entrepreneurH 1]
I know. And obviously we are looking for someone who believes in the product, who really believes in the cause we are doing, and that we go together to this. Someone who is passionate, someone who really joins this, which we really like.

[sharkH 5]
Well, just like the pizzas, guys, let the offers come out. 

[sharkH 5]
Adriana, take out the bills.

[sharkM 5]
Are you sure?

[sharkH 5]
First of all, congratulations on everything. The truth is that you have done very well. The pizza is very good.
I think you need someone much more expert in the industry. And I'm not that person. But I mean, I'm sure he's going to be a client and hopefully he's going to help you with something else.
But that's why I'm out.

[entrepreneurH 2]
Thank you very much.

[sharkH 5]
Here the two of us have an offer. 15% Ale, 15% me, and 4% of the sale. The valuation was very high for me.

But let's believe in this. Really, as Marcos mentioned, the marketing is great. And obviously, if you decide to join us, we're not just going to give you the money, but I would like to get my hands dirty and start working with you.

I think we can get a lot of potential out of you. If we investigate the part of freezing them and being able to enter supermarkets, I think we would break it there. And obviously, with the contacts we have, we can easily access these supermarkets as long as we have the product ready.

Do you want to add anything to our offer, Tokaya?

[sharkM 5]
Everything, everything, everything goes in line with my philosophy of work and life and everything. But the problem with that is that they put such a high valuation that we have no choice but to ask for a very high percentage so that it makes sense and so that we can recover our investment.

[entrepreneurH 2]
Thank you very much. Thank you. Well...

[sharkM 5]
I don't want to leave without giving you an offer.15%  More than 2% of the sale.

[sharkH 5]
Okay. Is this 2% and 4% forever? Forever.

[sharkH 5]
Jesus, Jim, I love entrepreneurs who seek to make a change in the culture and especially in the culture of nutrition in our country that we need so much. However, I think they do have a weak spot. It's their finances.

And precisely because the model is very specific and because it has to be very clear how these businesses work, I think I'm not the right shark. I'm out.

[entrepreneurH 2]
A question for both of you. Can we buy that 30% back 10% later? Are you open to that?

[sharkH 5]
It could be, yes. We could even add something else in case we need some kind of credit to really put gas into the business so that we can fly it and maybe go to a growth of 50%.

[sharkM 5]
Without a doubt, our offer is better. 

[sharkM 5]
Says who? 

[sharkM 5]
I say.

[sharkM 5]
Then it's not worth it. 

[sharkM 5]
I'll tell you why. Alejandro lives in Guadalajara.He knows the market there very well, which is where they're starting. I know the food market very well, restaurants, and healthy products.

[sharkM 5]
Yes, but if you want someone who goes from time to time, then it's in their best interest. If you want someone who's there at 100%, I'll buy you.

[entrepreneurH 2]
Well, it's a bit the proposal that interests us and obviously they're all very good. But... We'd like to go with Ale and you.
