I'm Alejandra Ibarra. And I'm Janet Salcedo. Janet and I, in 2019, with a great passion for entrepreneurship, created Veganísimo Superpostre, the world's first vegan cajeta, with a flavor and texture very similar to the traditional cajeta.

Our cajeta is made with soy milk, mascarpone sugar, ceylon cinnamon, and sodium bicarbonate, all glazed in glass.

[entrepreneurM 1]
Our product is obviously focused on vegans, but also flexitarians, lactose intolerant people, and also gluten intolerant people. This product has already been validated in the market, and today we are in 122 points of sale, two chains of premium supermarkets, and we have also been able to be part of two of the most relevant events in the food industry in Mexico and the United States.

[entrepreneurM 1]
The most important thing is that Janet and I, for Veganísimo, have four main objectives. The first is to enter one more supermarket store. This would increase our sales by up to 360%.

Our second objective is also to increase our sales in our online store. The third is to enter the hotel and restaurant chains. And as a last objective, we have to export our cajeta to the United States, since there is currently interest in buying our product.

We are asking for only 400,000 pesos for 35% of our company.

Where and how do you produce this product? 

[entrepreneurM 1]
We produce it here in Mexico City.We have a small specialized kitchen to make this artisanally.

[sharkM 5]
How much have you sold?

[entrepreneurM 1]
In these years, sales of 750,000 pesos in our average is approximately 180,000 a year, because we started with a few pieces, we sold 50,000. The following year we had an important growth, achieving 150,000. Our best year was 2021, where we managed to grow up to 300,000 pesos.
And well, 2022 we know, not only for us, but for many colleagues, it has been a difficult year. We had a fall.

[sharkH 5]
What did you do before that?

[entrepreneurM 1]
Well, I personally dedicate myself to accompany enterprises, and that's what made me fall in love with Veganissimo. When Alejandra and I talked, it was like, wow, there is no such thing.

[sharkM 5]
You comment that sales fell in 2022, against 2021. How much did they go down, and what are the reasons why you think they went down?

[entrepreneurM 1]
We are convinced of two things. One, of course, that we were having a peak of growth because of innovation. But we also believe that the post-pandemic issue was quite significant, because our product is premium.

[sharkM 5]
Let's talk about that. What is the price? 

[entrepreneurM 1]
The price of the public, on average, is 190 pesos.

[sharkM 5]
And its cost?

[entrepreneurM 1]
 The production cost is 57 pesos, but also, obviously, adding the logistical cost of such an operation, we end up at 92 pesos.

[sharkH 5]
They said that with one more store, they will increase 360%.

[entrepreneurM 1]
With a supermarket store.

[sharkH 5]
Why will they increase so much more?

[entrepreneurM 1]
What happens is that this chain we want to reach has many more points of sale. In other words, the ones we are in now have 12 and 14 points of sale.

[sharkH 5]
I'm reading a few things about the ingredients, like corn syrup, which in the world of nutrition or healthy food already has a somewhat complicated connotation. 

[entrepreneurM 1]
Yes, we know that. 

[sharkH 5]
Maltodextrin, which is not necessarily bad, because it gives volume.
And well, the label is long, it has many things.

[entrepreneurM 1]
Our soy milk has many ingredients, because we use soy milk powder. And also another thing, it is a sweet, it is not a healthy product.We definitely do not sell ourselves as a healthy diet, nor sugar-free, nor are you going to reduce the caloric consumption. In fact, we declare our labels there. It is an alternative.

[sharkH 5]
It is good that you are honest. Unfortunately, I am in that world, in the world of nutrition. I do stick to the label.I am picky. I think I am not the shark for you.

[entrepreneurM ]
Thank you, Mr. Mauri.

[sharkH 5]
Janet Alejandra, what a good mission.

[entrepreneurM 1]
Thank you.

[sharkH 5]
I like to explore a niche, and innovate in a niche where other people are not innovating, more with something so traditional. But they forgot one thing, in my opinion, which is the validation of the product. I mean, they entered a lot of stores.

A lot in each store. And you, I think you know that validation is the most important thing. And more to come and present it to investors.

Yes. And that's why I'm out.

[entrepreneurM 1]
Thank you very much.

[sharkH 5]
Well, I've been listening a lot. And... At least I learned something from some experts here who have a lot of experience.

And I'm not an expert on the subject, so I'm out for that reason.

[entrepreneurM 1]
Thank you very much. 


[sharkM 5]
I love investing in this type of project. In vegan projects, in healthy food projects.
And the truth is that it goes a lot with my philosophy. And the valuation you put and the percentage you came to offer makes me think that you need to land more on the financial issue. And that's why I'm out.But I wish you a lot of success because what you're doing is noble.

[entrepreneurM 1]
Thank you very much. 

[sharkM 5]
I have good news for you: your product is really delicious, and that's the most important thing. The flavor is great, and the consistency is very similar to 'cajeta' (a type of caramel), especially how it spreads. Personally, I'm very concerned about the drop in sales in 2022, the lack of repeat purchases, and the fact that sales were nearly cut in half and that why im out
