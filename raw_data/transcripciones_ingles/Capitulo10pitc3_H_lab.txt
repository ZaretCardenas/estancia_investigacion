I'm Ernesto Guerra, and I'd like to introduce you to Banteay. We are the first brand in the continent of America to manufacture ceramic refractory plates for cooking. Our goal is to provide our customers with a unique plate whose design and characteristics stand out from the rest.

Until the end of last year, we had billed around 72 million pesos, and in the same period of time, we have invested 27 million pesos. Our sales are through e-commerce, where we have a presence on the platforms of the most important minorities in Mexico and some in the United States. We want to increase our sales and lower costs.

That's why I'm asking for 5 million pesos in exchange for 10% of the shares. Before you comment on anything, I'd like to show you the characteristics I just mentioned. I don't know if you like it, Alejandra.

[sharkM 5]
Of course I do. What do I have to show?

[entrepreneurH 1]
Let's go over here. We're going to show you the stains. First of all, the safety.
Go ahead.

[sharkM 5]
Let's go. 

[entrepreneurH 1]
Here we have the label. If you like, you can put it on.
We're going to add some red wine.

[sharkM 5]
Here?

[entrepreneurH 1]
Here. Put it in the jar. Now we can clean the jar.

[sharkH 5]
What are you looking at? 

[sharkM 5]
Nothing got stained. T

[entrepreneurH 1]
he last one is the impact.
If you like, you can drop the pot on this side. 

[sharkM 5]
Like this?

[entrepreneurH 1]
Yes. Drop it.

[sharkM 5]
Is this ceramic?

[entrepreneurH 1]
It's a fine refractory ceramic. The body is very resistant to impacts. We can handle large pieces without deformation.

[sharkM 5]
It's very resistant. 

[entrepreneurH 1]
Thank you very much.

[sharkH 5]
Ernesto, explain to me the reversible part. 

[entrepreneurH 1]
Physically, this model and that one are the same.
So we have this design on one side, and we have a different design on the other side. 

[sharkH 5]
Where does your raw material come from? 

[entrepreneurH 1]
The raw material, in terms of clay, the United States has very good clay.
In terms of feldspath, silica, or tonitas, Mexico also has very good materials. We use Mexican materials. Thank you.

[sharkM 5]
How do you divide your sales between what you sell in e-commerce and through distributors?

[entrepreneurH 1]
Let's say that 90%, between 80% and 90% is through e-commerce, and the rest is with distributors.

[sharkH 5]
Tell us about the last three years in sales. Please, 22, 21, 20. How much did you sell in those years?

[entrepreneurH 1]
20 was around 12 million. 21 was something similar, 10 million, almost 11, and 22 was around 8 million pesos. 

[sharkH 5]
Sales are falling.

[sharkM 5]
Ernesto, you said you sold 72 million at the time, but the sum here gives me 20, 32 million in what you just told us, those three years. Does that mean that before 2020 we sold 40?

[entrepreneurH 1]
From 2014 until now.

[sharkM 5]
40 was before.

[sharkH 5]
In eight years.

[sharkM 5]
In eight years.

[sharkH 5]
Ernesto, I see a lot of competition in the market, a very competitive market. You have very aggressive competition.
I'm worried about sales falling. I think that has to do with your lack of channel diversification, and frankly, it's not a business that I would be passionate about. 

[entrepreneurH 1]
Correct.

[sharkH 5]
Therefore, I don't think I'm the right shark for you, and I'm out. 

[entrepreneurH 1]
Thank you for the comments.

[sharkM 5]
Ernesto, how much do you expect to sell in 2023?

[entrepreneurH 1]
In 2023, to be honest, the worst scenario is equal to 22. The best scenario, I think, is around 10 million pesos.

[sharkH 5]
Ernesto, look, I really like the logo, by the way. 

[entrepreneurH 1]
Thank you very much. 

[sharkH 5]
And the brand, I think it's cool.
And you make yourself a very honest, sincere, direct, hard-working person. Thank you. I have many doubts about your numbers, and about your sales, and about your valuation.

[sharkM 5]
And I think it's wonderful that you don't see I always admire entrepreneurs who want to compete against the big ones and fight against the big ones. I would review a lot the marketing strategies you have. I also worry a lot about the drop in your sales.

And this time, I'm not going to bite your project, for that reason. 

[entrepreneurH 1]
Perfect. Thank you very much.

[sharkM 5]
Ernesto, what worries me the most is your drop in sales.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Thank you.

[sharkM 5]
When you've had a trend for several years, you really need to stop, think about it, and verify what's going on. And for that reason, I'm out.

[sharkH 5]
Ernesto, my recommendation would be for you to look for someone who is super commercial.

That will help you a lot, because they can look for those channels. I see you as an inventor of a product, you handle that 100%, but you need the commercial part, and that will affect the sales. For that reason, I'm out.

Correct. Very good.

[entrepreneurH 1]
It was a very nice experience. I liked it a lot.

Thank you.
