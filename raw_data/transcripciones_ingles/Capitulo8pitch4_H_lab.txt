I am Mario Salgado, from the state of Oaxaca. I am the founder of Atom Innovatech. Atom Innovatech was born in 2016 to generate economic development through renewable energies.

In the Yucatlan community of Morelos, Oaxaca, we develop and manufacture Atom Solar 3. It is the result of more than five years of research and development in being able to perfect a system and a panel that does not require installation for its operation, since it has the intelligence to generate, store and distribute electricity and the Internet in an autonomous and portable way. We are currently in development and a month away from launching a new product called Kumora.

Kumora is the battery of a hospital, of a company, of electric cars. And as I always say, 100% made in Mexico. Our business model since 2017 is B2B.

For this reason, Tiburones, we are granting 25% of the company's and this great community's participation for an investment of 685,000 pesos. We work under the philosophy of the great Nikola Tesla. You have to have free, clean energy and we can say, energy for everyone.

Thank you very much. Now we are going to move on to how this system works.

[sharkM 5]
Can I go see you?

[entrepreneurH 2]
Of course. What is this? Let's see.

[sharkM 5]
Tell me. 

[entrepreneurH 2]
Ok. It has two conventional outlets for electricity.
It has a screen. The software is its own. The software tells you how much charge you are generating and how much you are consuming.
And on the other side of the panel, it indicates the system's charging capacity. There you can put it. Ok.
And now put it on. 

[sharkM 5]
You are hired, Alejandra.

[sharkM 5]
Did the lights turn on when I pricked it? Yes.

[entrepreneurH 2]
This exercise is very basic. You can supply more things. You can supply up to 15 LED bulbs at the same time for 4 hours at night or during the day.

Unlimited time. It is also used for civil work, for road markings, for mobile offices, and this shock test.

[sharkH 5]
Compared to a plant of, I don't know, 20 horsepower, how much does it produce?

[entrepreneurH 2]
Ok. Well, the plant of 20 horsepower is more powerful than this, obviously. But the problem with this plant, which is 20, 30, 40 horsepower, is how much time does the resource run out.

[sharkH 5]
Yes, they are gasoline.

[entrepreneurH 2]
They are diesel.

[entrepreneurH 2]
Now, in terms of life, the solar atom has more life because it does not need maintenance. It is maintenance-free.

[sharkH 5]
How long does it last ?

[entrepreneurH 2]
It has a life span of 25 years, but a battery change every 6 years that has a price of 2,500 pesos, the battery change. Let's give an example. A house can supply, without problems, from 10 to 15 LED bulbs at night for 4 hours.

At the same time, a screen up to 70 inches, a computer, a modem, and cell phones or tablets. What it cannot supply energetically is a freezer or a very large oven. That's where Kumora comes in, which is the new development.

[sharkH 5]
Kumora, how many milliamperes is it going to have?

[entrepreneurH 2]
Azo. We are talking about 40 times more powerful. 

[sharkH 5]
40 times?

[entrepreneurH 2]
Yes. And it has a weight of half a ton. 

[sharkH 5]
Indeed, Azo.

[sharkH 5]
Mario. Yes. Tell me, how many of these have you sold and how much does each cost?

[entrepreneurH 2]
This system costs 35,000 pesos. Ah, but with the Actor 3, as we had a great school in manufacturing, because no one taught us to manufacture technological issues, we were able to lower production costs and we have a 32% profit. For one.

If we do it in larger production, we can have a 40% profit. With the help of communities, because it is one of my conditions that it will never be manufactured in China or in another country. 

[sharkH 5]
Mario, in terms of design, does it bend to be transported or is it that size?

[entrepreneurH 2]
Ah, well, this is that size, but we are currently making a development. We still have about eight months to make it flexible. 

[sharkH 5]
But the panels are made in Mexico?

[entrepreneurH 2]
We don't have the necessary equipment to be able to manufacture, so we send them to Thailand, the solar panels. 

[sharkH 5]
How is this commercial process? 

[entrepreneurH 2]
It's a topic there, because when we sell those five, they want more.
The problem is how long it takes us to manufacture them.

[sharkM 5]
How long does it take you?

[entrepreneurH 2]
Three weeks to make one.

[sharkM 5]
What is your bottleneck and what could you optimize to lower production times?

[entrepreneurH 2]
Investing in the manufacturing of the systems. 

[sharkM 5]
Ok. 

[entrepreneurH 2]
We literally do everything by hand.

[sharkM 5]
So buying machines to...

[entrepreneurH 2]
CNC, all that, to make it faster and make it in production. 

[sharkH 5]
And how long will the process take? You said three weeks, right? Yes. Of production

[entrepreneurH 2]
 A week.

[sharkH 5]
A week, so... It's already 30 for a week. But tell us a little more about the demand for the product, because that, in the end, is what you're going to shoot the sales, right?

[entrepreneurH 2]
That's also why I want your support, because the three of us are practically dedicated to technology and the social part, but we are a little slow in the marketing market and all that.

[sharkH 5]
Mario, I'm very fast. So I'm going to make you an offer. I think your business needs a lot of work.

[entrepreneurH 2]
Yes. 

[sharkH 5]
You have some difficulties. For example, the price is high to be able to compete with the equivalent that could be a light plant or something similar.

I see risks because of the time your product takes, because of how little it has explored the market, but I like it. That's the kind of projects that excite me in Shark Tank. And so I don't want to miss the opportunity.

I'm going to offer you the money you're looking for, but for 30%. So I'm open to another Shark, if you convince him, another Shark to the proposal, because I also think the issue of credits, the issue of how to get people to acquire it, is going to be an important challenge. And if we have more Sharks in this project, I think we can do something very interesting.

[sharkM 5]
For me, one of your great advantages, and for which I congratulate you, is on the part of social responsibility. Do you remember, Marcus, that we joined Sunbank last year? 

[sharkH 5]
I remember perfectly.

[sharkM 5]
I think we can make an alliance with them and then look for credits to get these types of pieces, much easier to install. Of course, I am also happy to be part of it. You and me, Marisa.

[sharkH 5]
I'm going to give my quick summary here. A concern that I have, looking at business, I think you're asking for a little money for what you want to do. That's my observation.
I would have to show a little more traction, more of showing the commercial part. So that's why I'm out, but the world needs more people like you, attacking big problems, changing the world.

[sharkH 5]
I imagine that the most expensive part of this, because you said you store energy, is the battery, right?

[entrepreneurH 1]
We are going to start manufacturing new lithium batteries to start reducing costs. 

[sharkH 5]
That's how you're going to lower the cost?

[entrepreneurH 1]
Yes. The truth is that as a business, I don't see so many feet right now. But it's impossible that I don't come in with a person like you, who has developed this.
It's incredible. I can't stay out, so if you invite me, I will also join you with pleasure.

[sharkM 5]
I don't know, Marcos, because I just stopped to talk to Mauri and Marisa to tell them if they accepted my offer and if we made an offer of a little more investment. I can think of something. The current offer is three sharks, 900,000 pesos for 30%, but we want to include Marcos.

[sharkH 5]
I don't want to get in the way either. I mean, I participate in a sustainability fund in Latin America. If this works, then we'll put it in later with the fund too.
So if you want to put the three shards, I'm fine outside too. I mean, I want to support it. 

[sharkM 5]
800 for 30, and it's the same valuation.

[sharkM 5]
And it's the same valuation.

[sharkH 5]
The same valuation.

[sharkM 5]
800 for 30.

[sharkH 5]
Honestly, I think this is a project where the more sharks, the better. And I think if everyone is excited and we all want to get in, and everyone is excited, why fight? Invite the four of us.

[sharkM 5]
Speak, Alejandra.

[sharkM 5]
Mario, we wanted to propose that we give you 800,000 pesos for 30% of your company. So that's the offer we have for you.

[sharkH 5]
Among the four of us. Among the four of us. And you have the advantage that you take the knowledge and expertise of the four of us.

[entrepreneurH 1]
I came here, apart from looking for investment. I love to learn a lot of things because that's how you feed yourself. Learn and also that the young people in the community also learn from you.We have a deal. Nice.
