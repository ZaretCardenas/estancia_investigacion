Hello, sharks. My name is Adolfo Ferrer Jaime, founder and Sherpa of Lix, the school of creators. Today, I'm joined by Sebas Ayuso Aguirre, one of our students at Lix.

If the world has changed, education has to change. Since I was a child, I always used to tell my mom and dad, I don't know why I have to learn from memory the multiplication tables, or the hero children. And at 12 years old, I had the opportunity to participate in a robotics competition and I found a different way to learn, to create, to innovate, to make mistakes and that absolutely nothing would happen.

And it was at that moment that all my adolescence I was participating in these competitions and when I was finishing high school, I started giving math classes to the students of the language task force. And that's when we started Lix as a robotics and programming club. Until 2020, we were developing workshops in the afternoons, summer camps and courses.

And it was at that moment when the pandemic arrived and we were about to close. But our purpose of empowering and preparing more girls and boys for today's world did not close and we became a virtual educational model from kindergarten to high school and today we continue with it and also a face-to-face educational model with 230 students in different parts of Mexico. Today I am joined by Sebas to invite you to a project that I am sure will excite you a lot.

Hello sharks, I am Sebas, I am a Lix entrepreneur tinker and I have created several entrepreneurship projects. One of them solves the problem of addiction to video games. I don't know if you know, but about 10% of teenagers in Mexico have symptoms of insane amount of time in video games.

That's why with my team I created a device called AKS Bip, which we programmed and designed to avoid addiction to video games, generating a sound when you go over a certain type. But I am not the only Lix entrepreneur. Like me, there are many children and girls in Lix who have created entrepreneurship projects like a clothing brand, this bracelet, an art book and this gear.

We have created about 40 Lix entrepreneurship projects and among all we have generated 350,000 pesos. That is why today we come to invite you to create an investment fund of 500,000 pesos for 49% of a new company that invests in Lix entrepreneurship projects.

[sharkM 2]
Wow, congratulations Sebas.

[sharkH 2]
Great, Adolfo, so the children go through this process. You have 230 students and they end up creating a product.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Yes, the goal is that we make an educational model where we meet the learning objectives of each school grade, but in a transversal way, 20% of the time is dedicated to the solution of the challenge we set for them.

[sharkH 5]
For example, a young man who at 12 does not want to be in Lix and wants to go to a traditional school can continue without any problem.

[sharkM 4]
Instead of the traditional school, the traditional model?

[entrepreneurH 1]
Exactly, we certify, we meet the learning objectives that were set. We do a certification abroad, currently, but it has validation here in Mexico. 

[sharkH 5]
We are going to create a company that is basically a SAP and that is going to invest in how many projects?

[entrepreneurH 1]
Currently we have 40 different projects where what we are looking for is that the utilities that are for Lix can be reinvested in a fund for scholarships. 

[sharkH 5]
How do we generate funds for the projects? 

[entrepreneurH 1]
What we are looking for is that the same thinkers make their presentation, the need for the resources they require and in this same investment, this fund will have participations in different companies.

[sharkM 5]
Like a mini Shark Tank in Lix?

[entrepreneurH 1]
Like a mini Shark Tank in Lix, correct.

[sharkM 5]
Adolfo, the entrepreneur stays with a percentage or not? Because what I understand is that he becomes the owner of the project 100%, right?

[entrepreneurH 1]
No, what we look for and what we prepare is that the same thinkers have to make their business model, have to make their projections, make their Gantt diagram of everything so that it really is a project that gives it a follow-up. 

[sharkH 5]
And who would operate the fund? 

[entrepreneurH 1]
Well, you would make the investment and Lix would be the one who is developing all the monitoring of the projects, the support.

[sharkH 5]
Who operates that company? Because we don't want the kids to leave school and become such young entrepreneurs, right? 

[entrepreneurH 1]
What we are looking for is also that there is a commitment on the part of the families.
The best projects that the thinkers do and develop is also this involvement and that we also teach other families that the involvement of the family is super important for a better educational development.

[sharkH 5]
Adolfo, am I in the fund? If you manage to convince more kids, you have me, okay? That's my offer.

[sharkH 5]
I'm in.

[sharkH 5]
I'm also in.

[sharkH 5]
I'm not in the fund. If what you're trying to do is help, the money for a fund, I don't know if it's the right way to do it. I'm in as a mentor of the Fund very happy.

[sharkH 5]
Well, get in with the money if you want to help.

[sharkH 5]
If you want to help, I help a lot more with my time than with my money.

[sharkH 5]
Also that we can ingest and know what projects they are doing, who they are betting on, that we are involved in the selection of the children, it's not just that the money goes to you and you decide.

[sharkH 5]
I think it's a very delicate issue to put this burden of responsibility on them, not to mention that you're buying part of the company from a child at such an early age. You're practically investing in a lost fund. I'm not convinced that the model of the fund is the right way.

I understand that the dynamics of acceleration... Professor, are you in or out? I'm out.

[sharkH 5]
Perfect. I'm out. 
If you don't want to, I won't help you. Okay.
I have a very clear vision of how to help. And this is a model...

[sharkM 5]
But then, Adolfo and Sebas. Adolfo, what percentage of tinkers are women?

[entrepreneurH 1]
Practically, we have 45% of the league students are women and the remaining 55% are men. And we also have several entrepreneurs in it.

[sharkM 5]
I'm in.

[sharkH 5]
Awesome. So you have four sharks inside. Mauri, Liki, Ale and me.

Each one with 125,000 pesos. And we share 49% of the fund. We have a deal.

[sharkH 5]
What? A deal.
