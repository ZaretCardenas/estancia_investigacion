I'm Walberto García, director of Acupara. Imagine that I come from a planet very similar to yours, where unfortunately we could not convince neither society nor our people to be able to eliminate plastic, unicel and cardboard. When we realized, climate change had reached us.

That is why I come to warn you that you are still in time to save your planet. That is why Acupara, a 100% Mexican company, has developed the technology and thermoformable materials based on cornstarch, edible and disintegrable, such as plates, glasses, packaging materials. They have no gluten, oil, fat and are reduced in sugar.

That is why I come to offer you 5% of my company for half a million pesos. The company sold 400,000 pesos last year, but I don't want you to think about the past, nor do I want you to think about the present, I want you to think about the future. We can be the first company in the world to develop edible and disintegrable materials, but within everyone's reach.

I invite you to get to know the product. What do you want to see there? 

[sharkH 5]
Well, let's see.

[entrepreneurH 1]
If you allow me, I would like you to try the cones first.

[sharkH 5]
It has already ice cream?.

[sharkM 5]
Yes

[sharkM 5]
Alberto, explain to me what is the difference between this wafer, which is quite good in flavor, and the wafer that I buy regularly.

[entrepreneurH 1]
The wafer that you normally buy has gluten, has oil, has fat, and has a lot of sugar content. Mine has absolutely none of that and is reduced in sugar. That is why it has the unique characteristics that no one is going to give you.
I would like those who do not have chamoy to come closer. I'm going to bring the cone a little closer.

[sharkM 5]
The ice cream is great.

[sharkH 5]
Well, I already ate ice cream. 

[entrepreneurH 1]
Do you have the chamoy wafer? Did you try the chamoy wafer?

[sharkH 5]
No, I didn't try it. 

[entrepreneurH 1]
I need you to try it, please. 

[sharkH 5]
With pleasure.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Yes, please. I need you to try it.

It is very important that you see the glasses. This glass is made to replace the 4-ounce unicel and cardboard glass for the entire ice cream industry. It is also edible.

[sharkM 5]
Compared to an unicel, how much more are you up? 

[entrepreneurH 1]
I'm 80 cents up. 

[sharkM 5]
What percentage exactly?

[entrepreneurH 1]
I don't know, for example, a wafer has gone up a lot right now, but it's worth, I don't know, like 1.10, 1.20, and I'm at 1.80, for example. Not even 80 cents, 50 cents or 60 cents above what the market is. Unfortunately, in Mexico, that's why I haven't been able to sell, because it is very difficult to be above the market and say, hey, the characteristics that I am offering you are original.

It is the best wafer in the world and it is the best glass in the world. How can you compare me with something that everyone has, that the world has? I am offering you something that nothing in the world has, and that's it.

[sharkH 5]
If you increase the volume, you can lower your costs?.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Of course, of course. And now I want to talk to you about the dishes.
They are of different flavors, of different colors and of different designs. I have, that's strawberry, I have apple.

[sharkH 5]
Tell us a little more about what you did before, how you got here. It is important for us to know your story, right? 

[entrepreneurH 1]
Of course, of course.
I am engineer Alberto García, I am a food engineer, I have a master's degree in financial administration, I have another master's degree in marketing, and I have always been an entrepreneur. Since I was very young, I have been dedicated to entrepreneurship. I have been fired from ten companies seven times, so I have always been without a job, so in those links I am always innovating and doing projects and everything.

[sharkM 5]
You have been fired from ten companies seven times, but why?

[entrepreneurH 1]
Because look, I have always been a very restless person, too restless. And when a company no longer has the ability to give me what I want, or my boss no longer has anything to teach me, I get bored. So I'm always demanding from the company, I want more, give me more, I already master this, what else is there?

[sharkM 5]
And they fire you? 

[entrepreneurH 1]
They fire me because I don't leave, and the last time they fired me too, and I was the specialist in modified starches, and they fired me.

[sharkH 5]
Hey Inge, let's see, what I have not felt a little is that you say that you are very restless, that they fire you because you want more, but at the same time you say that you have not managed to sell the product well because people don't listen to you, because they don't want you. Yes. Let's see, those two things don't fit me.

[entrepreneurH 1]
I think that Mexico is still not the market for this type of product. This product is at $4 in the market. A plate of these characteristics is at $1.50. Less. The cardboard plate is at $2.50. For this relationship of $1.50, I can't sell a plate like that. People will always look to pay the lowest price.

[sharkH 5]
Inge, let me tell you something. I don't agree with you that you have not been able to sell because people are not ready. On the contrary, they are ready.

So the focus should be to lower the price of the product to compete with what is cheaper. That has to be your focus. Another thing that I didn't like is the appearance of the product.

I don't doubt that you already saw it with the formula, but you have to find a way to improve it so that it can be attractive for a businessman like me. And for those reasons, you haven't caught me, but I wish you a lot of success.I am out.

[sharkM 5]
we care about the valuations and if the numbers are important, and you can't get here with a valuation 20 times higher and offer us 5%, why not? I would focus on improving the flavor.
And for all those reasons, I'm also out. 

[entrepreneurH 1]
Okay, thank you.

[sharkH 5]
I don't agree with everything you've said. I'm going to tell you why. I think we are demanding too many things from you for such an early company.

Remember the valuation, which is very high. I don't know much about the industry and there are things that are difficult for me to evaluate, but I'm going to make you an offer. I'm going to offer you.

Sit down with you and see if we can help you commercialize a little more. We don't have someone in Canada, for example, who is commercializing. Canada is a great market.

For now, I'm out. But with pleasure, I support you.

[entrepreneurH 1]
No, thank you very much. Thank you very much. And another thing that I also have to show you.

Look, this material that you see here is fully integrated. You can put whatever you want. And with just putting a movie on it, we can have a low-cost, disintegrable material in the market.

[sharkM 5]
Why did you value your company at 10 million pesos?

[entrepreneurH 1]
Look, the value of the company is really nothing. For us, yes. No, I'm going to tell you why.
Because I have a company. I don't come so much for the value of the money. That's not it.
You are businessmen and we know how difficult it is to get half a million pesos. Sincerely, it's not a big deal.

[sharkM 5]
From what I've known you here, I think I can see why you haven't lasted in your jobs. It's obvious that you lack patience. You lack the ability to listen better and improve your attitude.
And that's what I didn't like about you. And that's why I'm out.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Thank you very much.

[sharkH 5]
I have to confess that I'm not the shark for you. My feeling is that we wouldn't be a match in terms of work style, your openness. I think it's a little defensive in the way you do things.
And when I socialize with people, I really like to connect. I don't feel that way, that's why I'm out. 


[entrepreneurH 1]
Well, thank you very much.
