I'm Alejandra Rodr√≠guez, CEO and co-founder of Ibasco, a specialist in e-commerce.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Hi, I'm Diego Masayi, co-founder and specialist in the traditional channel.

[entrepreneurM 1]
Before talking about Ibasco, we want to tell you about Nora, one of our first customers. Nora is a 60-year-old woman, she is the support of her family and also has to take care of the business of the house. Nora has a corner store.

Like Nora, in Mexico there are a million corner stores that go through the same problems when it comes to their customers. They have to close their business to go to the center and to the supply market. When they get there, it turns out that the prices have changed and that day the money is no longer available.

In addition, they must have a logistical transport and if they do not have this transport, they must pay up to 500 pesos. If it were little, as you know, they handle more cash and therefore they do not have or are not fit for credit because they are not within the system of banks. Thinking about Nora and all the stores in Mexico, we created Ibasto.

Ibasto is a platform that goes to the corner stores through a simple web app. We have a catalog of 1,200 products and we take them to the doors of your store. Sharks, here comes the interesting part.

With a history supported by Ibasto of 5 purchases, we get them to have credits thanks to the financial alliances that we made.

[entrepreneurH 1]
In Ibasto we have 4 ways to generate income. The first is with a margin of 8 to 13% for each closed order and we are working to grow this up to 25%, increasing the purchases that we make to our suppliers but keeping the prices at the corner stores. Two, we charge the shipment between 25 and 35 pesos.

Three, the commissions of the services that the owner of the store offers to his clients through the Ibasto application and finally we receive a commission for each credit that we place thanks to our strategic ally and the data that we generate. Last year was a great year for Ibasto. We won 4 acceleration processes, we delivered more than 3,400 orders and we had more sales above 6.5 million pesos and that is why we are inviting you to participate in Ibasto with an investment of 3,040,000 pesos per 4% of the company. 

[sharkH 5]
What have these 4 accelerators that are worth so much to put a pitch? 

[entrepreneurH 1]
Many of the strategies that we have seen currently in the market is the very large acquisition of clients and the issue of making money only from the margin of the products and this is where these alliances come from that currently we could not operate ourselves alone, but it is through the credit that you can grow that ticket. 

[sharkH 5]
Of these 6.5 million pesos in GMV or sales of products, how much is the company's income?

[entrepreneurH 1]
Of course, right now we are obviously in red numbers, we are not profitable yet. 

[sharkH 5]
No, no, no, the question is of 6.5 million pesos in sales, how much was in the end the margin? 

[sharkH 5]
Of utility.

[sharkH 5]
Not of utility because they are losing money.

[sharkM 5]
How much is it in fees?

[entrepreneurH 1]
Between 7 and 14%.

[sharkH 5]
No, no, no, of the 6.4 million pesos. It is not between 7 and 14.
How much was last year? Last year it was 8.

[sharkH 5]
8%? 

[entrepreneurH 1]
Yes. That is, 

[sharkH 5]
480 thousand pesos more or less.

[sharkH 5]
What rate of credit does it have?

[entrepreneurM 1]
It has a rate between 40 and 80, it depends on the size of your annual store. The first 14, 15 days we do not charge them interest, they have up to 15 days to pay.

[sharkH 3]
Well, they were talking about losses, I don't know how much they have lost.

[entrepreneurM 1]
around 7 million pesos. 

[sharkH 3]
Last year, 3,400 orders. How many stalls or stores on the corner do you have?

[entrepreneurM 1]
We have 900, 145 active customers who ask us every week.

[sharkH 3]
And monthly, for example, how many of these 900 do they ask you?

[entrepreneurM 1]
145.

[sharkH 3]
Weekly 145, monthly also the same 145?

[entrepreneurM 1]
Yes, because they ask more than three times a week. Sorry, per month.

[sharkH 3]
But if they don't ask once a week, then they don't ask even once a month? 

[entrepreneurM 1]
Yes. 

[sharkH 3]
Ale and  Diego, for me this is a business of loyalty.

We are in a country where still the trade and food of the majority of Mexicans is through these sales stands, these stores. And that this is intended to take care of the people's pesos. That generates economy, generates prosperity for the country and in that sense I think I am glad that there is a project like yours.

[sharkM 3]
Ale and Diego, how are you going to do it? What plans do you have to get your company worth the 75 million pesos they are asking for?

[entrepreneurH 1]
Currently we have an average ticket of 1,800 pesos and we are going to increase it to 3,000 pesos. That is going to be done through strengthening this issue of credit, giving it to disclose even more, that increases the ticket and also increase the catalog. The second is that right now we have an average of our clients of 2.5 purchases per month for each one and we know that we can grow it up to 3.2 times. And finally, the growth of clients, obviously. With this round we are looking for a 12-month runway and that is going to lead us to have 6,100 clients. There are around 25,000 stores, so our strategy is not based on getting 100% of the market, but on getting the clients.

[sharkH 3]
But your strategy is based on 25% of the market. 

[entrepreneurH 1]
Yes. 

[sharkH 3]
It's difficult, isn't it?

[sharkH 3]
Why would the funds be interested in something like that?

[sharkH 3]
Well, because the funds bet that another fund puts a lot more money in it.

[sharkH 3]
Today many funds do care about profitability because the moment has changed, but the reality is that this is a game in which if today we lowered the valuation and took 50% of this company among the other four, we would kill it. They are going to need 10 million dollars, 15 million dollars. The funds play this game, but it is a game of valuations in which in the end, the payout will come at the end of the story and not in a monthly dividend.

[sharkH 3]
Let me tell you where I stand. The first thing I'm seeing is that the business is in the financial one. Obviously, the rates they are charging the users are very high.
They have losses of 7 million, they are asking right now for a valuation of 75 million pesos when they have sold practically nothing. So, right now as we are saving it to recover our money, we would recover it in 120 years. So, I'm out.

[sharkM 9]
I don't see clearly how they are going to get from 300 active and recurring monthly clients they have right now to 6,000 clients in a year. I wish them a lot of success, but for those reasons and for the high risk I see to this investment, for me as an investor, I'm out.

[sharkH 9]
Alejandra, let me tell you where I stand. Excel can handle everything. And in reality, there is a gap between where the business is and the valuation they are putting.
And that's why I'm out.

[sharkH 1]
I'm not scared of the valuation. I understand the angle from where they are valuing it. They are a company of technology and they are walking the path of venture capital and a valuation of 4 million dollars for the stage they are in.
I think it's even reasonable. It's very noble what they are doing, but for me it's something I'm not willing to do and I'm out. 

[sharkH 1]
I love that they are looking for a solution for people who need it the most.
Where I don't fit in is in this venture capital model. For those reasons, I'm out. I wish them a lot of success.
