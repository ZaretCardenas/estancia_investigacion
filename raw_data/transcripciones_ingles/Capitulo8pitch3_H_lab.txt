How are you? My name is Bruno Lim贸n. Mine is Armando Reyes, and they call me Pepino.

And together we are Pepino con Lim贸n. Three years of the pandemic left many opportunities, many learnings, and above all, this need to be close to nature. From there, the business opportunity and the creative idea of bringing these living beings home and being their accomplices with the lovers of the plants of the entire city of Mexico, not only the landscape designers, interior designers, designers, but also the mother, the father, the son, the millennial, the centennial.

Pepino con Lim贸n has no labels, and that is the most important thing.

[entrepreneurH 2]
We created an e-commerce and opened a boutique. Our e-commerce is a very friendly page where you can choose the size of your pot and customize the color. There you also choose the plant, whether it is sun or shade.

Within the boutique, it is a fabulous experience, from the issue of the aroma, the colors. We also have something very successful within the services we offer, and that is the plant hospital. You can take your plant, and we diagnose what it has, we cure it, and you get it ready.

Another of the services we have is the plant pension. When you go on a trip, we take care of your plant, and we return it to you in the best conditions.

[entrepreneurH 2]
During two years of operation, just completed in February, we have sold more than 35,000 products, of which 12,000 have been plants of different species, 13,000 have been pots, and the rest is made up of accessories created by us with Merchandising. To grow and scale the business of Pepino con Lim贸n, we are looking for a person who shares our vision of loving nature, the interior design, so that he joins us with 1.2 million pesos for 20% of the company. Which of you sharks joins us and shares this passion for nature?

[sharkM 5]
A question on money. How much did you sell in 2022, and how much did you sell in 2021, which was your first year?

[entrepreneurH 2]
In the first year, we sold 3.6 million pesos, with a profitability of 15%. In the second year, we sold 3.7 million pesos, with a profitability of 25%.

[sharkH 5]
Armando Bruno, of the four lines of business you mentioned, the hospital of plants and the pension of plants, which are the ones that differ the most from everything else? 

[entrepreneurH 2]
Yes, totally. 

[sharkH 5]
What percentage do you represent in sales?

[entrepreneurH 2]
The percentage of sales generated by the whole brand is 80% boutique and 20% e-commerce. And in the 80% of the boutique, it is linked to 25% of the income of new services, because our consumer repeats 5 to 6 times.

[sharkH 5]
What is the future of the business? Is it online? Is it in the store?
Where do you see the future in the next 3, 4, 5 years?

[entrepreneurH 2]
We see the future in e-commerce, because we are definitely in a stage and in a digitalized world. The boutique was created because our consumer wants to see the plant, wants to see the pot, they want to have the experience.

[sharkM 5]
What percentage does each of the companies have?

[entrepreneurH 2]
In terms of percentages, 50% and 50%.We both make the decisions. 

[sharkH 5]
Pepino Bruno, how is the logistics? I buy a plant online, how do you deliver it to me?

Do you take the plant? Do you have a delivery truck and you take it and deliver it?

[entrepreneurH 2]
The Pepino Mobile is adapted for the plant, not for us, you know? If there is a logistics person that we have to take care of, because in the end it is also an extension of Pepino and Bruno that will serve the client as designers and interior designers.

[sharkM 5]
Hey, I love the designs and what they are doing, I love the plants, but I don't really see the differentiator.

[entrepreneurH 2]
We have several. The issue of the hospital.

[sharkM 5]
Sorry, I think the differentiator is rather that, the hospital.

[entrepreneurH 2]
The hospital, the pension.

[sharkM 5]
And the pension, because the rest you mentioned, the other stores also have it.

[entrepreneurH 2]
Yes, some do. Nobody sows you. We make the client's life easier by taking their plant sown, fertilized and cleaned.

[entrepreneurH 2]
Yes, it is the service and the cool. The truth is that we are a very cool brand. 

[sharkM 5]
Bravo for your self-esteem.

[entrepreneurH 2]
Totally. 

[sharkH 5]
Bruno, Armando, you did something very important, which is to improve the margin. 

[entrepreneurH 2]
Yes, yes.

[sharkH 5]
But sales didn't go up. 

[entrepreneurH 2]
No. 

[sharkH 5]
Why?

[entrepreneurH 2]
The traffic we generated was very gradual. All the people from the pandemic began to return, especially in the boutique and e-commerce. In reality, we stayed there until we could have an investment with the right logistics and not go wrong with a client.

[sharkH 5]
What is the projection of sales in the future? 

[entrepreneurH 2]
With the investment we have, we are going to increase sales by 10% for next year, because in reality we have not yet invested digitally in e-commerce. What has been sold is in an organic way.

[sharkM 5]
In other words, the expected sale for 2023 is 4 million?

[entrepreneurH 2]
Yes.

[sharkH 5]
Look, with what you answered now, I'm going to tell you my position. I think it's a very cool business, but this is what I would call a lifestyle business. I would be talking about investing 1.2 million pesos and increasing sales by 300,000 pesos. So the growth is going to be slow and the return for the investor I think is going to be difficult. And that's why I'm out.

[sharkH 5]
I'm a plant lover. My office is a jungle. The truth is that I don't see the business elements and I don't see a vision that catches me.

And so I'm out. 

[entrepreneurH 2]
Thank you. Thank you very much.

[sharkH 5]
Well, Bruno and Armando. For me, as an investor, what I see is that the growth and the projection they have is very little. I think, and I've seen several attempts of online plants, and they cost a lot.

So, for those reasons, I think I'm going to be out.

[entrepreneurH 2]
Thank you. 

[sharkM 5]
Bruno and Armando, I think you have two types of business. One is the service you're providing with the plant hospital and the plant pension, which I thought was the coolest thing.
The other is the sale of plants and pots, which doesn't have that much of a difference. If I were you, I would focus more on working and growing the part of the service, which is the original part, and which can give you more benefits. But seeing it as very little scalable and taking a lot of time to do it, I'm out.

[entrepreneurH 2]
Thank you very much.

[sharkM 5]
Pepino and Bruno. I'm fascinated by plants. I love them, I have a lot.

But it's not a business we can invest in. I'm out.

[entrepreneurH 2]
Thank you very much for the opportunity. Thank you.
