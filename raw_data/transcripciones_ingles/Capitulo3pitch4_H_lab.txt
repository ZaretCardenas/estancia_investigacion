Do you like ice creams?

[sharkM 2]
Very much.

[entrepreneurH 1] 
Did you know that 90% of the ice creams we consume are full of artificial colorants, flavors, sweeteners, and although they fill them with preservatives, the bacteria continue to reproduce? Well, this can change with liquid nitrogen. I am Omar Sapien and I am the founder of Ice Cream Nation.

We are the first 100% Mexican brand specialized in making ice creams at the moment with liquid nitrogen. Thanks to this freezing method, the ice crystals that are formed are much smaller and this translates into a much softer texture in the mouth. But the best of all is that we get the flavors of the real ingredients, like yogurt, fruits, cocoa, liquors, cakes.

The truth is that the possibilities are endless. We've been doing this for seven years. We do events, we do festivals, and we currently have five branches in Mexico City.

Today we are ready to show that a small Mexican brand can revolutionize an entire industry. That is why today I come to invite you to be part of this story for 4 million pesos for 10% of the company. Do you want to come and see how it's done?

[sharkM 5]

Yes, of course. Omar, 
[sharkM 5]
how much did you sell last year?

[entrepreneurH 1]
17 million. This one here is apple pie and we make it with real apple pie that we bake and you can put the toppings you want.

[sharkH 4]
Let's see, look. This is apple pie. So to understand, you baked an apple pie and then froze it.

[entrepreneurH 1]

Exactly.

[sharkM 4]
 How much did you sell? 

[sharkH 4]
17 in 2022.

[sharkM 4]
Thank you. And in 2021?

[entrepreneurH 1]
21. 

[sharkM 4]
And that? 

[entrepreneurH 1]
We lost sales from one store for eight months and from another store, also like four months in relocation.

[sharkM 2]
Hey, Omar, tell me something. The fact that you do it in the moment, does it take time? 

[entrepreneurH 1]
That's right.

[sharkM 2]
Do you have more peak hours that people are uncomfortable with or is the customer usually satisfied with the waiting time?

[entrepreneurH 1]
That's a very good question. The waiting time on a weekday with a normal flow that reaches maybe one or two people is five minutes on average.

[sharkM 2]
Ah, okay.

[entrepreneurH 1]
But on the weekend, if it is very full after the time of the meal, which is just our peak hour, Saturdays and Sundays, our waiting time can be about 10 to 15 minutes.

[sharkM 2]
Ah, it's not that bad. 

[sharkM 2]
Omar, but I see you have some jars back there. You make a pre-mix.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Exactly.

[sharkM 2]
And with that pre-mix, as they are doing the chocolate one right now, you pour that pre-mix and then you add ingredients. Or how does it work?

[entrepreneurH 1]
Yes, we have a police station where we produce all our recipes every morning. So they are fresh ice cream. They don't have preservatives, they don't have colorants, they don't have artificial flavors, and as you said, we get the flavor of the real ingredient.


[sharkM 2]
Two questions.

One, calories compared to a common ice cream, and percentage of usefulness.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Okay. Calories. Here you can move as you want because the nitrogen freezes it.

This one that they will now try with chocolate, a large ice cream of 180 grams only has 166 calories.

[sharkM 7]
Wow.
Super good. Omar, I'm sorry. I'm missing the usefulness.

[sharkM 1]
Ah, but he hasn't answered me how much usefulness, how much percentage. Okay.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Net, 12%. 

[sharkM 1]
12% net?

[sharkM 1]
Margen Bruto?

[entrepreneurH 1]
Between 50 and 55.


[sharkH 4]
Average price of an ice cream?

[entrepreneurH 1]
127

[sharkM 1]
Let's touch it.
Now, here comes the most important question. Where is the chocolate ice cream?

[entrepreneurH 1]
Where is it? We'll take it.

[sharkM 1]
Why did you value your company at 40 million pesos?

[entrepreneurH 1]
Two years of sales and a return of about five years.

[sharkM 1]
Let's see, give us the numbers. How are you going to return the money? In five years?

[entrepreneurH 1]
With four million pesos, we can open five more branches. With ten branches, we can sell around 40 million a year. With a net margin of between 20 and 25%, it throws a return of between four and five years.

[sharkM 1]
A million pesos a year, four or five years.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Hey, Martin.

[sharkM 1]
Tell me.
Don't you think this concept is out of fashion?

[entrepreneurH 1]
No. If it were just a show, and we invited you to a place on the street, and it looks like a show, but I give you a crappy product, you'd be afraid. But I have a lot of confidence in the product.

[sharkH 1]
Well, I'll make you an offer.
I'll offer you half the money, but for 10%. Waiting for you to join me.

[sharkM 1]
I'll join you. To Marco's offer, I'll offer you the other half, but for another 10%.

[sharkH 4]
We're talking about four million, but for 20%, divided by two.

[sharkM 2]
Between the two, each of us gets two.

[sharkH 3]
I really enjoyed thinking about your business. I think it's very interesting. As an entrepreneur, I really liked you, because you're right on the mark.

I don't think I'm the right track for you, in this particular case. I also enjoyed eating ice cream, but I'm out. Thank you.

[sharkM 2]
I love ice cream. I really like your concept. I didn't like that you didn't grow from 2021 to 2022.

I'm out.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Thank you.

[sharkM 2]
You have a great offer. I... I'm out, but I'll leave you in good hands.

[entrepreneurH 1]
I love the offer. I love what you two are doing. I'd like both of you to join me, but for 15%.

[sharkH 2]
The valuation we're giving you for today is fair.

[sharkM 2]
So, you and I, our offer is two million. And two million, each for 9%, which would be 18%. Do we have a deal?

Do we have a deal? Do you accept it?

[entrepreneurH 1]
Okay, 

[sharkM 2]
we have a deal.

[sharkH 2]
Yes, we have a deal.
 
[entrepreneurH 1]
We have a deal
