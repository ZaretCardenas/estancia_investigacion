Hello, sharks. I'm Natalia Silva. I'm a fashion designer and I'm the founder of Long Clothes Brand.

At Long, we believe that behind every piece of clothing, there's a story. The t-shirt you wore during college, maybe a suit your dad gave you, or your son's favorite blanket. At Long, we're an expert service in preserving these stories and rehabilitating them so they can continue to have a useful life.

We do this through four main services. The first is repair. And this has to do with patching, sewing, changing a closure.

We do this from a design perspective so it doesn't look like we did anything to the garment. The second is alteration. And it's changing the size of a piece.

The third service is personalization. And this is putting your personal touch on the clothing. We've been operating for just over three years and in that time, we've rehabilitated over 13,000 garments.

My offer is $110,000 pesos for 10% of Long.

Tell us a little about this. Do you do this in stores? How does the business work?
What's the client's experience like?

[entrepreneurM 1]
That's right. We have a store in Colonia Roma, here in Mexico City. And our service is very demonstrative, in front of the client.

[sharkM 5]
Natalia, did you bring an example so we can see the adjustments you're making?

[entrepreneurM 1]
Yes, of course. In fact, I have two very special examples. One of you sent us a t-shirt.
A black t-shirt. This is from Oso. Your t-shirt was a very basic black sports t-shirt.
We know you're someone who likes sports, especially with your family. So we made some scarves that you can wear with your family during winter sports.

[sharkH 5]
They're made with my t shirt?

[entrepreneurM 1]
With your t-shirt. Let's see. Let's see, 

[sharkM 5]
show us.


[entrepreneurM 1]
Well, two are for your children's.

[sharkH 5]
They put the t-shirt inside, right?

[entrepreneurM 1]
Yes, for winter sports.

[sharkH 5]
These are good.

[sharkM 5]
What else do you have there, Natalia? Keep showing us. Very good.

[entrepreneurM 1]
This is your garment. You sent us a white t-shirt that already had some wear on the arms. So we removed the wear from your t-shirt and merged it with this other t-shirt.

[sharkM 5]
Wow! It's really cool.

[entrepreneurM 1]
Thank you very much. 

[sharkM 5]
It's really cool. I love it.
Thank you very much. You surprised me. Thank you.
Natalia, how much did you sell last year? We sold 2 million pesos. Okay, and how much was left of utility?

[entrepreneurM 1]
Of gross utility, we have 30%. Of net utility, we are at 10%.

[sharkH 5]
How does this grow? Because if it has so much design, it is not something that can be scaled so easily. You would have to have a fixed designer in each of the locations.
How do you plan to scale this business?

[entrepreneurM 1]
Without a doubt, I would like to have more branches. I mean, it's not just me as a designer in my workshop. There is already an in-house designer.
Because in the end, I am in charge of the operations. And also the sewing people are very involved with the client.

[sharkH 5]
In the end, you can't systematize.
Because each of the designers you have in each place will do different things, right?

[entrepreneurM 1]
Yes, but there is also that freedom. Maybe if I have two designers, well, I like her more and I still do business with her.

[sharkM 5]
You are coming here to ask for 110,000 pesos. That's right. Why are you asking for that amount, that money?

[entrepreneurM 1]
The issue is that our problem is not so much sales. Fortunately, we are receiving many prizes. My problem is the operation.I need to make my operation more efficient. If I increase, for example, in just three people who join my team this year, I will be able to increase my sales by 100% this year.

[sharkH 5]
Have you tried to get a good loan? Are you giving a lot of your company for 100,000 pesos?

[entrepreneurM 1]
As I said a while ago, for me, the reason to be here is above all to look for this mentorship.

[sharkH 5]
You are looking for someone with smart money.

[entrepreneurM 1]
Exactly.

[sharkH 5]
You have to work a little bit on your mentality. I don't want to ask for a loan, I prefer not to ask for a loan. If you have understood your flows well, if you have understood your operation well, and you can plan and you know that in three months you are going to start generating, it could be a very smart way to finance yourself.
Now, if they don't give it to you because you don't have your company well organized, I mean, are you a constituted company or are you kind of managing everything in a workshop style?

[entrepreneurM 1]
I operate as a physical person. Because, yes, from the beginning, I have been there in the head.

[sharkH 5]
With two million pesos in sales, maybe it's time to take that leap.

[sharkH 4]
You know what, Natalia? I think you don't necessarily need a partner. That doesn't mean that you are looking for help and that seems very kind of you.

I would even tell you, you have a fantastic profile as an entrepreneur. You are organized, clear, you have a knowledge of your business. But precisely because of that, I am concerned that your business depends a lot on you.

Therefore, not knowing how to help you more than that, I frankly, although I would love to work as someone like you, for what you project me, unfortunately I am out.

[entrepreneurM 1]
Thank you very much.

[sharkH 4]
I wish you a lot of success.

[sharkH 4]
I think you are spectacular as an entrepreneur, you have done it perfect. Here's what I'm going to offer you. I'm going to offer you advice.

All the back, you have to dedicate yourself to what is yours. I'm not going to ask you for a percentage, only if you want. I don't want to sacrifice you because you're really asking for very little for that 10%.

So, I can help you with all the back, to help you make a company, a structure that you have. And I do it, obviously, from the heart, with great pleasure, without giving you money or asking you for anything in return.

[entrepreneurM 1]
Thank you very much.

[sharkH 4]
For that reason, I am out of the investment, but you can count on me for the support you need.

[entrepreneurM 1]
Thank you very much.

[sharkH 4]
I think that with the sales you have, you can surely get credit. You don't have to give a percentage in exchange, and I'll gladly support you. But for the moment, as an investor, I'm out.

[entrepreneurM 1]
Thank you very much. Oso, what are you going to do?

[sharkM 4]
I see that you have a very good offer here from Marcos and Lichi, and I'm out.
 Natalia, the first thing you have to do to be able to have a partner is to build your society. I am a partner of a basic clothing company with a model of Mexican just maquila, called Básicos de México.

And I love to tackle this big problem that is the fast fashion industry and the damage it is doing to our planet. I can think of a very cool way to grow your business. Yes, you're going to have to stop being so perfectionist, because I imagine that you are, and what I offer you is to open points of receipt of merchandise in the basic stores, and then send it to an operations center, which can be your store that you currently have in La Roma, where the work is already done, until the time this infrastructure lasts.

And take the word from Alejandro and Marcos to help us with all the structure of your company and all the commercial part that they can contribute to us and that they can help you. So that, take it. 

[sharkH 4]
With great pleasure, of course.

[sharkM 4]
And what I offer you is that in exchange for 10%, I give you the investment you came to ask for. How do you see it? Do we have a deal?

[entrepreneurM 1]
We have a deal
