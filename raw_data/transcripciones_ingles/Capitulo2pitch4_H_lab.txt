My name is Ángel Villanueva, I am the founder of Gastop Master Coffee, a shop specialized in the sale and commercialization of high quality coffee, 100% Mexican. Since 2013 we have been roasting coffee, but as a result of the pandemic in 2020, we decided to migrate all our efforts to e-commerce, having incredible results. Currently, we have billed 5 million pesos this year, and we are here to take this dream to the next level.

We are looking for 1 million pesos in exchange for 10% participation. This will allow us to increase the production capacity that we currently have. Will you allow me to make you a coffee?

It's a Japanese siphon.

[sharkM 3]
So you're literally going to give us a coffee? 

[entrepreneurH 1]
Yes, of course. 

[sharkM 3]
Come on!

[entrepreneurH 1]
We brought you a gift, it's the same coffee you're going to drink. It's a coffee from Coatepec, the farm is called Herradura. They work with microlots and everything with rainwater.

So we always try to explain all that to the client, the coffee they are getting.

[sharkH 4]
It's like a more artisanal type of coffee, right?

[entrepreneurH 1]
Yes, yes, of much higher quality and above all, something very important is that it is traceable. You know where you bought it, what farm it is from, what producer it is from, even what region of the farm it is from, and above all, who roasted it. 

[sharkH 4]
Ángel, could you explain a little bit about the process of what you are doing?

[entrepreneurH 1]
This method is from 1800 and was invented for the consumption of tea.

[sharkH 2]
We can say that your coffee, although it is prepared in a normal way, as it is prepared in most houses, does not vary or maintains a spectacular flavor, just like what you are doing with this.

[entrepreneurH 1]
You prepare it with your coffee maker at home or in a very expensive machine. The point is the raw material and that is of very high quality. Here I am stirring it, here the water has already risen, the water is rising.

[sharkM 5]
Wow! And is all the sale online?

[entrepreneurH 1]
All the sale is online, except for the majority, but they also arrive through the online store. And for example, how much does this one cost?

[sharkM 5]
How much does it cost you?

[entrepreneurH 1]
It costs me 155. I have a net margin of 35% of all the products. It will vary a lot because the fair trade agreement is what the producer decides how much his coffee is worth, we pay for that.
If it is worth it. Of course. 

sharkM 5]
And public price?

[entrepreneurH 1]
500 pesos. The coffee is ready.
So you already saw that it is completely dry. It just separates.

[sharkH 2]
Ángel, it is clear to me that your knowledge of coffee is extensive. Are you inviting us just to this brand or to the universe of the platform that you have for the sale of coffee?

[entrepreneurH 1]
I am inviting you to everything that can be seen through Gassup. Whether it is an online store or as much as possible. Right now what we have physically is the online store.

[sharkH 4]
So to understand you well, you buy coffee from different producers. And obviously you already have a relationship with the producers for a long time. Or are you looking for new ones?

[entrepreneurH 1]
We have what we always have and we keep looking for more. 

[sharkH 4]
Only from the region that you said?

[entrepreneurH 1]
We have Oaxaca, Chiapas, Veracruz, Guerrero, Jalisco. People believe that there is only coffee in Oaxaca, Chiapas and Veracruz. The reality is that we have 13 production areas in Mexico.

[sharkM 2]
Thank you very much. Go ahead. It's very good.

[sharkH 1]
It's delicious. 

[sharkH 1]
Why do you value it at 10 million if you sell five? 

[entrepreneurH 1]

Twice sales.
I mean, it made it easier for us to work with that number. Because we have been growing year by year. So that's why we value it twice sales or three times utilities.


[sharkH 3]
What projection do you have for this year? 

[entrepreneurH 1]
Three and a half million in online store and two and a half million in wholesale.

[sharkM 3]
Now you mentioned something about your three times utilities. So tell me what your utilities were from last year.

[entrepreneurH  1]
Our utility depends a lot on all products. But gross is 50% and net is 35 to 38%.

[sharkM 3]
But from the utility of the company, from the 5 million you sold last year, how much do you have left?

[entrepreneurH  1]
1,400,000. 

[sharkH 3]
But if you multiply that by three, doesn't that give you 10 million? 

[entrepreneurH  1]
No, it's correct.

[sharkH 3]
You said three times utilities.

[entrepreneurH  1]
Yes, it's correct. It's 5.5 million.

[sharkM 3]
Be careful with the numbers, Ángel. Because you are amazing. 

[entrepreneurH  1]
Thank you very much.

[sharkM 3]
The product is very good. But remember that here you are in the tank and you come to negotiate. So you have to know the numbers perfectly.

[entrepreneurH  1]
Perfect. Thank you very much.

[sharkH 2]
Ángel, the fair trade you have with the producers, what does it consist of?
Fair prices or do you give them some utility? Do you distribute some utility? How does it work?

[entrepreneurH  1]
They decide the price. In principle, they say, you know what, Ángel? My coffee costs you, I don't know, 150 pesos a kilo.

We try it and see if it's worth 150 pesos a kilo. If it's spectacular or exceeded our expectations, we tell them, you know what, I'm not going to pay you 150, I'm going to pay you 170. 

[sharkH 2]
It's great.That's great. That you don't abuse the producer, that you give him more if the coffee is better.

[entrepreneurH  1]
 Well, I don't live without them.

[sharkH 4]
I'm going to make you an offer, Ángel. I really like what you're doing. I think I loved it.

Obviously, as an entrepreneur, you know your business 100%. You have worked it from scratch. That speaks highly of you.

You have achieved very good sales last year. This year I think you are going to go a very good way. I'm going to offer you the million you're asking for, but for 20%.

Once I get my million back, I'll give you back 10% of the shares. 

[sharkH 4]
I immediately join that offer if you accept it. Welcome.

[sharkH 4]
Ángel, I'm not going to make you an offer. I'm going to make you a proposal. I have a conflict.

I sell coffee too, okay? I can't invest in another coffee. That's a business incongruity, right?

But I love you as an entrepreneur. I think you have a lot of knowledge. You are building a brand that is selling well.

I think you're going to do very well. I want to offer you an exchange. I can give you an advice.

And in return, I ask you the opposite. That you help me analyze the coffee I currently have. That you can honestly tell me what you think of it.

If there is a way to improve it. And if there is an opportunity, that you help me get closer to how I can get a better coffee. With you as an ally.

That's my proposal to you. 

[entrepreneurH  1]
No problem.

[sharkM 5]
Ángel, I didn't like the coffee. Okay. The numbers don't make sense .

Okay. You need to build your brand. And for that you need a lot of money.

So for that reason, I'm out. 

[entrepreneurH  1]
Okay, thank you very much.

[sharkM 3]
Ángel, I really like the focus of your business. I love the fair trade part. I was thinking a little while ago.

There are already coffee producers like that. There is already a lot of competition. And then I said, what does it matter that there are more like you?

That's the joke. So I'm also going to make you an offer.

[entrepreneurH  1]
Okay.

[sharkM 3]
I offer you the million pesos that you come to ask for 20%. The same. I alone make this offer to go with you.

[sharkH 2]
What do they offer you beyond money?

[sharkH 4]
There you go, what can we offer you? To start, I also import matcha tea. We pack it.

I also have the cogs. It's not coffee, but it's tea, but it's very similar. Obviously capital.

If necessary, obviously in the future we can practice some kind of credit. I think Marcos can contribute a lot to the table too. Business development, promotion.

And obviously also the whole topic of marketing. All that roll we can contribute a lot. 

[entrepreneurH  1]
Okay.

[sharkM 3]
I contribute to the development of the brand. I think it is necessary to do a lot of branding and that I can help you. I can also help you grow the sales of Mayoreo.

That is, to take you to hotels, restaurants, banquets and other food companies that use this product and constantly want to improve the quality and find products with these values that you bring to the table.

[entrepreneurH 1]
I'll stay with Marcos and Alejandro.

[sharkH 4]
We have a deal. 

[entrepreneurH 1]
Yes, we have a deal. Hey, great.

[sharkH 4]
Congratulations. Thank you very much. A lot of success.

[sharkM 5]
Now you lost Ale.

[sharkM 5]
I'm not happy.
