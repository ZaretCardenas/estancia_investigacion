I am Alan. And I am Alfonso. We are Founders of Admission Universidades, a university advisory program with which, over the years, we have contributed with the income of more than 3,000 students to the Universities of Mexico.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Currently, today, there are more than 2 million Mexican students who are about to start the university stage. However, they do not know where to start or what they have to do to enter an admission process.

[entrepreneurH 2]
We know that this path should not begin with the choice of the university degree. This is essential because it must go hand in hand with their skills.

[entrepreneurH 1]
We managed to develop in them, first, the mastery of the subjects of their admission exam. Second, increase up to 95% their self-confidence as young students. And third, that they can really have mastery of the Hard and Soft Skills, which are useful tools not only for the exam, but for daily life.

[entrepreneurH 2]
Well, we started this project seven years ago. We have accumulated sales of 10 million pesos. This 2023 we are waiting to close sales for 4 million pesos.

2024 we plan sales of 9 million pesos. This thanks to the opening of a new business unit in Guadalajara.

[entrepreneurH 1]
And that is why we want to invite you to have a participation of 15% of our company in exchange for 800,000 pesos. However, before you give us the yes, we are going to relive for you the experience of an admission exam.

[sharkM 5]
Alan and Alfonso, tell us a little bit about the business model and how you make money with this business.

[entrepreneurH 1]
This university counselor program requires the student to prepare for their admission exam. That's why they sign up, pay a series of partialities and receive not only classes with teachers, but a whole program in charge of psychologists and experts in all emotional areas of the students.

[sharkM 5]
And do they guarantee me to enter the university I want to enter? Or how does it work?

[entrepreneurH 1]
Sure. The program has a duration of 4 to 6 months depending on which study option the student chooses. The methodology allows us to guarantee that 9 out of 10 students pass the admission exam to the option they want and the university they want, as long as they comply with 100% of the contents of the program.

[sharkM 3]
How much enthusiasm is there in this? Because nowadays, and it is seen on all social networks and everywhere, that people don't want to go to school. People want to start a business.

[entrepreneurH 1]
In order to be an entrepreneur, you must master certain basic skills or essential knowledge, from communication to administration. So when the students come to us, it is mainly the interest of the parents, to say, hey, tell me what you are doing and what can I do so that my son who wants to do many things, how can we guide him?

[sharkM 3]
These students, after they enter the university, do you have any other contact? Do they continue?

[entrepreneurH 1]
The part of post-entrance to the university, we have achieved agreements where these people receive access or exchanges abroad, for example, from summer camps, but also graduates from high schools to join the economically active life, for example, on international cruises, speaking of gastronomy students, on the right side, to have a diploma abroad, in the part they studied. But is that a plan or do you already do it? No, it is already established, the part of the agreements.

We are generating more and more students and we are concerned by the part of the practices, professionals and social services in schools.

[sharkH 4]
They talked about that they have helped 3,000 students. What percentage of them enter public universities? What percentage of them have entered private universities?

[entrepreneurH 1]
90% public universities, 10% private universities. 

[sharkH 4]
What is the most common product, so to speak, and how much does it cost?

[entrepreneurH 2]
Look, it's the preparation program. Obviously, this program focuses on which university you want to enter and the average cost of this program is 6,120 for the time indicated from 4 to 6 months.

[sharkH 4]
They talked about the numbers of 2023, 2024, but they didn't talk about 2022. 

[entrepreneurH 2]
Of course. 

[sharkH 4]
How much did they sell in 2022?

[entrepreneurH 2]
In 2022, we sold 3 million pesos with a gross utility of 2,200,000, an operating utility of 1,500,000 and a net utility of 1,000,000.

[sharkH 4]
But they said they sold 10 million pesos in seven years and in the last two, they sold nine. Of course. All the other five sold one.

[entrepreneurH 2]
Exactly.

[sharkH 4]
Alfonso Alan, let me tell you where I am. Yes. I like what you do.

I mean, this is a social business, it's a business that helps young people, etc. But I get the impression that there are things that they say to say and they don't have depth. I mean, like there are things that don't make me click.

And I'm out. Okay, Marco.

[sharkM 4]
I'm just like Marco. Like, I still don't understand the approach that his company has. There's something I don't like about his answers and that's why I'm out.

[sharkM 4]
I'm going to tell you something that you probably won't like. But it's a reality that the Sharks are losing. Yes.

They're not being clear, concise, concrete with what they offer. For that reason, I'm going to give you the opportunity to mention the three things for which I would like to invest with you.

[entrepreneurH 2]
We're worried about the young people. We want them to enter the universities. Two, we want to grow to other states to support the young people of those states.

And number three, because we know that you can contribute a lot to opening up our doors. But what are we going to contribute?

[entrepreneurH 1]
Connections. And apart from the know-how that you have in your companies and the experience, I consider it invaluable.

[sharkH 4]
Look, Alan, Alfonso, you didn't finish hooking me up. You didn't convince me of your vision and how. For those reasons, I'm out.

Thank you.

[sharkH 4]
I'm out, but I would like to see you in the future because your ideas land well, they land well in the direction you want to take this company because I think you can grow it very well. I wish you a lot of success and I would like to see you in the future.

[sharkM 4]
I do like it. And I would include a business school program You're adding a service. Yes, but I like it.

I would like to add that service and see what other things we can take from there because maybe, yes, it's true, it's a lot. They need to be very concise. So, therefore, I'm going to make you an offer and I'm going to give you the $800,000 you're asking for for 30%.

[entrepreneurH 2]
Okay.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Thank you very much for all your advice. Thank you and we'll take the offer.

[sharkM 3]
So, do we have a deal?

[entrepreneurH 1]
We have a deal.

[sharkM 3]
Yay! Thank you. Thank you.

Come here, my boy.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you all, really.

Good luck.
