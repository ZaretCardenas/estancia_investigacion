There is a town in the township of Milpalta, a town that is dedicated to the production of mole. This town, through 75 years, has managed to create a great company. We are all part of it.

This town produces around 20,000 tons per year. In 1950, my mother, Mrs. Chonita, started with several families to produce this mole. This mole really took a peasant community out of poverty.

I started in 1975, selling this mole in a market in Mexico City. I was there for 20 years. In 1994, I formalized the production and sale to the majority.

But in 2009, I founded Procesadora de Moles Don Luis.

[entrepreneurM 2]
When we realized that the market for commercial mole was already saturated, we decided to innovate with a different product. A product aimed at the gourmet market. We selected 22 high-quality natural ingredients, and with our semi-handcrafted process, Mole Gourmet Don Luis was born.

It is currently available in the chain of departmental stores with the highest coverage throughout the country, in top restaurants in Mexican gastronomy, in different gourmet stores, and in the duty-free shops of the Mexico City airport. We achieved sales in 2022 for $1,765,000, with a 30% to 35% utility margin. We have an installed capacity to produce five times the sales of last year, but we require a partner who supports us with capital to improve the price of our supplies.

We are also ready to start exporting. We are requesting 800,000 pesos in exchange for 12% of our company. Sharks, it's time to taste the best mole in the world.

Proudly from San Pedro, Antoctan, in Mifalda, Mexico City.

I love mole.

[entrepreneurM 2]
You're going to love this one.

[sharkM 5]
Let's try it.

[sharkM 5]
Is it your mother's recipe, Mrs. Chonita?

[entrepreneurH 2]
Yes, initially she taught the whole family how to make mole. Over time, we adapted it to the palate of the people.

[entrepreneurM 2]
This mole is not going to make our stomachs heavy, it does not cause cramps, everything is perfectly balanced.

[sharkH 5]
I'm going to finish it in spoonfuls. Me too.

[sharkM 5]
Cancel dinner. I'm going to have dinner here.

[sharkM 5]
Let's go. How much does the product cost? 

[entrepreneurH 1]
This mole costs 85 pesos.

[sharkM 5]
And how much do they sell it for?

[entrepreneurH 1]
200 pesos. 

[sharkM 5]
Who is your biggest competitor, especially if you think about exporting?

[entrepreneurM 1]
There are different brands of mole, but we are focused on a gourmet market. We started 12 years ago as pioneers of gourmet mole in Mexico. And we don't have a defined competitor.

[sharkH 5]
Mr. Luis, I'm sorry, Magaliel, I don't want to assume, but who did you ask about the numbers?

[entrepreneurM 1]
Both of them.

[sharkH 5]
Why did you evaluate the company at this price?

[entrepreneurM 1]
Our evaluation was based on future flows. We are projecting a growth of 50% in the first year. So we know exactly where we are going to grow this first 50%.

Exporting, restaurants, reinforcing sales force. Why did my dad and I achieve this 1,765,000 pesos alone

[sharkH 5]
Did you make an assessment of discounted flows at 5 years?

[entrepreneurM 1]
At 5 years.

[sharkH 5]
I am interested. First, I am fascinated by the product, the flavor is incredible. They don't know, but I am a gringo.

So I came to Mexico. A good part of it is food. People, obviously, but the food is incredible.

So I am fascinated by mole. And I think that with my contacts in the United States, I can ensure at least one meeting and see if I can give them something. But I think that is the added value that we have.

But I would like to see if someone here, there are two women here who are in food. I trust their palate a lot, let's say. And business.

So if you are interested, I would like a little more equity here. It's short for me if I share that with another shark. So I am thinking more, reaching some 30%.

I am more interested in investing and being part. Because it will require a lot of work to be honest. So I am interested in that if someone...

[sharkM 5]
No, I was just, I really liked your story. Thank you. I was doubting because I don't have the expertise to export and open doors in the United States.

But when I heard that Ryan does have them, we might be able to do something together.

[sharkM 5]
Don Luis and Magaly. My grandmother was the best thing in my life. She always cooked and cooked deliciously.

And she always made a mole on December 25th. And we all got together, all the women in the house, and we cooked with her. And the truth is that I would love to be part of, in this case, the story of your grandmother, Mrs. Chonita. So I would also like to join the offer of Ryan, together with Marisa. And then we would be getting together, Marisa, Ryan and me.

[sharkH 5]
10% each for $800,000.

Here’s the translation while respecting the text in brackets:

[sharkH 5]  
Don Luis, Magaly. I think it's one of the best moles I've ever tasted in my life. And I love mole.  

And I'm always looking for a good mole to eat. I think all Mexicans should try this mole. Really, congratulations.  

However, I think you have a very attractive offer from three sharks that I believe can help you much more than I can. Therefore, I wish you a lot of success. For those reasons, I’m out.  

[entrepreneurH 1]  
Thank you.  

[sharkH 5]  
My recommendation is that you negotiate. Yes, yes.  

[sharkH 5]  
Pretend I’m saying the same thing Maury told you. I loved it. It’s delicious.  

But those who really know about food are over there. And you can export to the United States. Don't go without negotiating that 30%.  

It seems a little exaggerated to me.  

[entrepreneurM 1] 
Yes, of course.  

[sharkH 5] 
So, for now, I’m out.  

[entrepreneurM 1]
Thank you, Marcos.  

[sharkH 5] 
You have two sharks out and a joint offer from three sharks for $800,000 for 30%.  

[sharkH 5] 
And remember, they obviously know their history in food and everything. It’s a matter of experience they have.  

[sharkM 5]
What do you say? 

[entrepreneurH 1]
This is my dad’s life work. He’s the one who will decide.  
We’ve done the calculations, and we know why we can grow 50% in one year. We just need to reach 30 more restaurants than we already have. 

[sharkM 5]
And I can help you with that.  

[entrepreneurM 1]
I want to tell you something we didn’t mention. We started Mole Gourmet because it was her idea. After finishing her studies, after doing everything, we began looking at how we would advance into another market, another niche.  

Because the commercial mole market is saturated. So, we sought a better market where, honestly, we work less and earn more.  

[sharkH 5]
Don Luis, do you have an option? I mean, do you want to accept the deal? Do you want to negotiate it?  

[entrepreneurH 1] 
What we can do, well, if you want more percentage, then give us more money. Invest more money. This is profitable.  

I’ve spent my life working and doing.  

[sharkM 5] 
Don Luis, what’s your counteroffer?  

[sharkH 5] 
That.  

[sharkM 5] 
Do you already have it prepared?  

[sharkM 5] 
Are you interested here? 

[sharkH 5]
We’re interested. 

[entrepreneurH 1]
A million for 15%.  

[sharkM 5] 
A million for 21%.  

[entrepreneurH 1] 
No, for 15%.  

[sharkH 5] 
The thing is, with that percentage, we have to dedicate time, energy. So, it’s important to have at least something a bit more negative in terms of equity.  

[sharkH 5]   
So, what’s the offer? I was saying it could be a million, but for 21%, so you have 7%, I have 7%, and Ale has 7%.  

[sharkH 5] 
Do you want to talk a little? Do you want me to help you? May I advise you?  

[entrepreneurH 1] 
Yes. Thank you. 

[sharkM 5] 
Don Luis is a tough negotiator.  

[entrepreneurM 1]  
Well, we’d love to have not just one shark, but three sharks supporting us with this. Our offer is, if we meet the projections I’m telling you about, and you recover your money in five years, well, in these projections we’re negotiating, you now hold 21%, but give us the opportunity to get back 6%.  

[sharkM 5] 
At what valuation will we return it?  

[sharkH 5] 
Permission, Ale?  

[sharkM 5]   
Yes, of course.  

[sharkH 5]  
So, you’ll come in with the million for 21%. Yes. They’ll be generating profits for you based on the sales they just projected.  

And once you recover the money in these five years, they’ll return the 6% and you’ll hold 15% of the company. But you’ll have already recovered your money.  

[sharkH 5]  
You know what? I love the confidence you have in what you’re doing as well. That attracts me.  

I feel connected to that because you have to believe in yourself.  

[entrepreneurH 1]
 We know the product we have.  

[sharkH 5]  
There’s no other way to do it. So, for me, I’m in.  

[sharkM 5]  
So, do we have a deal?  

[entrepreneurH 1]  
We have a deal.
