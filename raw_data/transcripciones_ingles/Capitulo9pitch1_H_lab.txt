My name is Rodolfo Col√≠n. It is an honor for me to present to you today PETLOC Animal Search. We are dedicated to finding lost pets.

We arrived the same day to the search area with a team of four specialists. Each specialist carries a megaphone where the characteristics of the lost or lost are reproduced and the voice of the father or mother is adapted. While we are walking on the street we carry body bags that allow us the neighbors at the time of seeing us to identify the situation we are doing.

We use professional search drones that help us to have a clearer vision of the area mainly in cases of feline search. We have to have a greater analysis on rooftops, treetops and places where we do not sometimes have a clear vision. We use motor vehicles.

These vehicles each have three speakers where the voice of the father or mother is reproduced at all times and the incentive there is for the person who gives us information. To date, we have been able to support up to 3,000 little ones who are already at home thanks to the search strategies. We made the emergency situation viral.

Apart from the support that is given in person, we recorded a small clip where in this clip we reflect how important it is for the lost person to return home and this clip spreads on social networks, which gives us greater visibility. Today, sharks, we want to invest 10% of PETLOC in something that you know is more valuable than money and that is knowledge. Advise me once a month for a year.

Currently, we serve five states of the republic. We have offices in Mexico City and today people from Guadalajara, Monterrey, Quintana Roo talk to us, but unfortunately we do not have offices and we cannot go to those areas.

I want to know what radio you are looking for.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Well, at first, the little ones can go up to eight kilometers in one day. What we have to do is get to the search area as soon as possible and make a circular search diameter, starting from point zero, which is the last point of sight of the little one, and we go to a location, to later return to point zero and in this way start making a circular search diameter that guides us the information we are gathering.

[sharkM 5]
Do they charge for this service?

[entrepreneurH 1]
Approximately an average of 4,000 pesos.

[sharkM 5]
By day of search or by pet?

[entrepreneurH 1]
By pet, by the search protocol. This search protocol is two days in person, four-hour days in the field, supported by three specialists in the area. Support in digital media is more time because there is a monitoring of up to ten days.

[sharkM 5]
If they charge 4,000 pesos per search and have recovered 3,000 little ones, does that mean they have had sales or income of 12 million pesos?

[entrepreneurH 1]
That is an approximate, since the cost we handle right now is not the cost with which we started the search. We started not charging. 

[sharkM 5]
Last year, how many income did they have?

[entrepreneurH 1]
Well, we approximately serve three little ones a day. What it does, that is an approximate, because there are days where we serve up to eight or ten services. On average, there are three services a day, which is 90 supports a month and there are more than 1,000 supports a year.

[sharkH 5]
I understand the social aspect and I love it, but this is something you want to dedicate the rest of your life to.

[entrepreneurH 1]
For me, it's not a business, it's a dream. And we know that money is needed.

[sharkH 5]
Besides being a dream, it's a business.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Today, every search we do generates a margin that allows us to reinvest for new materials.

[sharkM 5]
How much are the operating expenses of the company per month?

[entrepreneurH 1]
A little over 100,000 pesos.

[sharkM 5]
100,000 pesos cost you, and from what you told us, you have about 90 searches a month, which is 360,000 pesos. If it's 100,000 pesos of spending, you earn 260,000 pesos.

[entrepreneurH 1]
There is a margin of 25% of each support plan. It's the margin we have for reinvestment. Everything is reinvested because sometimes, not only do they ask for a motorcycle, they ask for a car, they ask for three, they ask for five.

[sharkM 5]
How much does a car like this cost?

[entrepreneurH 1]
Approximately 100,000 pesos.

[sharkM 5]
Rodolfo, I love what you're doing, but it's also a great business. So you can't stop looking at it like that. If you focus a little on the business, you'll be able to grow faster and rescue more animals.
So, what you come to ask for, I offer it to you. 10% of the company for advice once a month. I'm in with you if you accept my offer.

[sharkM 5]
I also offer the same offer. 10% of the company for advice.

[sharkH 5]
It's okay if you want to do something social, it's okay if you're passionate about it, but this is a business, and it doesn't have to be social or economic. I'm in, and I'd love to donate some of my time.

[sharkH 5]
I'm also in, Rodolfo. You're going to continue with the social part, which is amazing. I'm in, and I offer you my advice to really turn that part into a business.

[sharkM 5]
I've already changed my offer. I'm going to give you what you asked for, the 10%, the advice, and I'm also going to donate five of those cars.

[sharkH 5]
Yes!

[sharkM 5]
Wow!

[sharkH 5]
In other words, you don't want us as partners.

[sharkH 5]
I'm going to tell you that I'd love to help you too. I think you have an amazing offer. If I were you, I'd take it.

And I don't want to compete with that offer, because I think it's very good.

[sharkM 5]
You can come in with me if you want.

[sharkH 5]
What I propose is that if we all want to come in, then somehow you invite us all, we all help you, and because we all want to help you, and I think that instead of you coming out with the idea of coming out with a shark, you come out with five sharks, and the five of us can help you.

[sharkM 5]
And you can give us 2.5%. Each one for... What? An advice every two months from each one.

[sharkH 5]
Hey, but are the cars still standing or not?

[sharkM 5]
Of course they're still standing, but no, I want them alone.

[entrepreneurH 1]
The truth is that I'd like everyone to join in. It's going to be the best-invested money. I can tell you that we could, as a project, give you the names of each one of you, and we'd notify you.
Each little one that meets that motorbike, you participated. So, don't miss this opportunity to help.

[sharkH 5]
I'll join in by donating a motorbike, if it's divided...

[sharkH 5]
Between the five of us. Between the five of us. Each one a car.

[sharkM 5]
I'll join in too.

[entrepreneurH 1]
So, each one would get a motorbike and an advice every month.

[sharkH 5]
Listen, all I'm saying is that maybe it's not necessary for you to need an advice every month. We can make a program where we can give you advice quarterly, for example, and I think that's enough to give you some indicators that can help you improve your project.

[sharkM 5]
I'd make this offer. We're going to donate a motorbike each, which is worth approximately 100,000 pesos, and we're going to give an advice every three months each for 5% each of your company. Are you in?
Do we have a deal?

[entrepreneurH 1]
I'm in. I'm in.
