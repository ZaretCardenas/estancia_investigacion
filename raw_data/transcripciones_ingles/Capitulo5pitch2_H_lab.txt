Hello, sharks.

[entrepreneurH 1]
My name is Juan Carlos. My name is Nicolás.

[sharkM 2]
Nicolás, why do you look so familiar?

[entrepreneurH 1]
Me?

[sharkM 2]
Yes, I think I follow you on social media.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Oh, that's great. 

[sharkM 2]
You have several businesses, right? Yes, yes, yes.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Yes, entrepreneurship has been a way of life for a long time. You're right. 

[sharkM 2]
Tell us a little about your story and Maruica.

[entrepreneurH 1]
To put you in context, we have been working in the optical sector for more than ten years, where we have been able to collect the different insights and needs of the consumer to put a unique product in front of you today.

[entrepreneurH 1]
On the one hand, we are facing this fourth industrial revolution where screens have practically become an extension of our body, because the impact that this blue light is generating on our body is supremely harmful. On the other hand, humans are facing the worst environmental crisis in the history of humanity and if we really don't change the way we are doing things, we are going to end up with the ecosystems of this planet.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Under these two parameters, Maruica was born, a conscious brand of glasses for screens that seeks to represent the different ecosystems in each of its collections. Today, Maruica works hand in hand with the five most important environmental foundations that work in each of these ecosystems. That is why, Tiburones, today you have the opportunity, literally, in front of your eyes to be part of the change.

[entrepreneurH 1]
We want you, with all the experience and knowledge you have, to help us be able to replicate this successful model that we have in Colombia and take it to the American market and the Mexican market. Tiburones, we want to offer you 10% of the company in exchange for $100,000 to be able to make this expansion plan a reality.

[sharkM 2]
Let's see if I understood correctly, you are just going to start in Mexico and you would invite us to whatever you do here in Mexico and also export to the United States? We invite you to the whole business.

[sharkM 2]
And then, with more reason, tell us a little bit about your sales in Colombia. 


[entrepreneurH 1]
Look, last year we sold approximately $80,000. We have been two long years where growth has been exponential and already after having tested in Colombia and having obtained positive results, we feel now ready to take the next step.

[sharkH 2]
And is it with recycled material or why did you talk so much about the environment?

[entrepreneurH 1]
Of course, let's say that to be consistent with the whole philosophy of the brand, we could not make glasses made with oil, so we used a material called vegetable cellulose. It is a pulp that is made from wood and cotton, turning this material, the glasses, into a model that is also sustainable.

[sharkH 2]
It seems that it is synonymous with profit, but is that just talking about the associations? I mean, do you donate some of your income to any of these associations?

[entrepreneurH 1]
Yes, monthly we send them a sales report and where there is a percentage that goes to be able to attack these environmental weaknesses that exist in the world. 

[sharkM 2]
What percentage does it give you? 

[entrepreneurH 1]
The percentage of foundations goes between 8 and 10%.

[sharkM 2]
Of the top line?

[entrepreneurH 1]
Of the top line.

[sharkH 2]
Juan Carlos, Nicolás, I want to tell you where I stand. Really, how cool is the issue of social and environmental awareness. And now I'm going to tell you the things that maybe won't seem much to you, but I think they will be important.

I think it's a great product. Really, it's top quality. But you said something very important.

You said, we need a shark that knows the market. That's what you said in text.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Clearly, someone who understands the market is important, but those of us who also know the market are us and those of us who know the product are us. So, a shark that has the contacts would help us a lot because we can join forces of knowledge with commercial growth.

[sharkH 2]
I don't think I'm your ideal shark to make this expansion that you are visualizing. And that's why, although I wish you a lot of success, I'm out.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Thank you very much for your words.

[sharkH 2]
I've seen a lot of these glasses on the market and they go from $10 to $100. How much do these cost in the public market and what is their cost?

[entrepreneurH 1]
Look, our cost is $11.50. And we are selling them for $40.

[entrepreneurH 1]
It is very important for us to understand that we have an added value that today we feel makes the difference when buying the glasses. And with this, it is giving its grain of sand to the conservation of ecosystems.

[sharkH 2]
I would rather buy one for $5 and donate $35 to the foundation. 

[entrepreneurH 1]
There are not many places where you can find this material, bioacetate, let's say all this storytelling and comfort and design, you know?

[sharkM 2]
In general, in consumer products, there are two ways to sell. Either you capture the existing demand or you create demand because you invent a product that does not have so many options. I think you chose a product where you have to create demand.

And the most difficult thing is to change the consumer's habit. However, I am fascinated by your brand. Think about how you can expand the brand with this beautiful thing that you have done in terms of branding, in terms of lightness and good design.

Think about what product does have demand, since it can use all those characteristics. I'm out, but I hope you take advantage of this great job to pivot the brand.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Thank you.

[sharkH 2]
And where do you sell the glasses?

[entrepreneurH 1]
We are selling them in our digital channels, we are selling them in our optics, we have optics and we have some clients who are also optics in Colombia.

[entrepreneurH 1]
What Nicolás mentioned has been a very important point. Today, our different competitors have told us that surely I can have glasses that protect from the light of the screens, but I cannot have a brand endorsed by the five most important environmental foundations. Therefore, our biggest competitors today have become our biggest distributors of our brand.

[sharkM 2]
But isn't that reflected in your sales? 
[sharkH 2]
Nothing. 

[sharkM 2]
You've only sold $80,000 in all of 2022.

What's going to change in 2023?

[entrepreneurH 1]
That's why we're here, because we need experienced people who understand that we have a winning product that can be replicated in all markets.

[sharkH 2]
Let me ask you a question. Why did you value it at $1 million? .

And 12 times sales?

[entrepreneurH 1]
Yes. Clearly, let's say it's a high value, but we feel that this brand has a great potential that with this money that we're going to raise, we're going to be able to have enough capital to be able to enter the American market, the Mexican market. Mr.

[sharkM 2]
Carlos and Mr. Nicolás, I applaud your presentation, I applaud your passion. What I don't applaud so much is your evaluation. 

[entrepreneurH 1]
Well, here we can also... I mean, we come with an idea, but you should be able to negotiate.

[sharkM 2]
For me to be able to justify, as an investor, such a high valuation, I would need to see evidence of its potential for growth that is much more faithful and much clearer. And for that reason, I agree.

[sharkM 2]
Juan Carlos and Nicolás, I think the packaging is too much for the product you sell. Saving this packaging, so sophisticated, so expensive, with so much printing, plastic, and it ends up polluting more than it helps. I greet brands many times, they grab this flag of I am ecological and for one more marketing issue.

And that's the impression they give me.
I'm out, but I wish you a lot of success. Thank you very much.

[sharkH 2]
First of all, congratulations. I loved the glasses, the product is very, very cool. I am involved in this, I know the glasses market, because I sell glasses.

I mean, I'm looking at how to get in, but they came to ask for a million when they have not sold practically anything. Maybe because of the passion they have for the brand, because of the passion they have put into the business of so many years of working on this, they think it's worth something that still isn't worth it. Maybe one day it will be worth it, but today, since it's not worth it, I'm out.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Thank you very much.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Well, thank you all for your time.
