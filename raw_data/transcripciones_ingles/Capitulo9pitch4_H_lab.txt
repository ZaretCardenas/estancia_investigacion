How's it going, sharks? Nice to meet you. I'm Oscar Garza.

And I'm Marco Polo Gil, technology director. Our company is Journey Sports, and we're here to present a story like that of thousands of other athletes. This image you see on the screen is a jaw fracture.

The culprit of this jaw fracture was a kick in a Taekwondo event. Now, those nails, to put them on is very expensive, but above all, it's very painful. And I know that last one, because that's my jaw.

Sports injuries are one of the main causes of abandonment in the entire world of sports. But more so in a country like Mexico, where 96% of the 48 million people who do sports in this country don't have any kind of insurance if they get hurt. Because of this and a thousand other stories, we decided to create Journey Sports.

Our mission is to democratize access to sport and protect its practitioners. We do this through very accessible insurance that guarantees the payment of a sports injury, the theft of sports equipment, and the civil responsibility in sports events. We have a set of products for insurance.

Our main product is sports accidents. This includes from consultation to surgery. The coverage ranges from 50 to half a million pesos, and we cover more than 140 sports.

All the sports you can imagine come under our coverage, which can be per day, per month, or per year. With this, we include three main services. A medical network composed of doctors with a specialization in sports medicine.

On the other hand, we have a program of benefits with discounts on sports products and services. And finally, we have a program to prevent injuries that we share with our clients, which are sports organizations.

We have created the technology that allows people to insure themselves in less than five minutes. The athlete can select their insurance at the time they want to pay for their marathon registration. Or simply the family that wants to protect themselves from sports injuries on an adventure tour.

All this thanks to the API that we created, which connects with third-party services and platforms. Currently, we have 42,000 athletes. We started in 2020, and we already have 300 medical services.

We have the highest recommended rate on the market.

[entrepreneurH 2]
Sharks, today we are a profitable company, without investment, and we have grown 80% year over year. But we know that adding not only resources, but also the experience of cracks like you, will help us take our mission to the next level. So we came up with a proposal.

Five million pesos for 10% of our company.

[sharkM 5]
What are the coverage levels that you offer?

[entrepreneurH 1]
We offer from 50 to half a million in multiples of 50,000. So 50, 100, 150, up to half a million pesos.

[sharkM 5]
How do you earn? What is the model?

[entrepreneurH 1]
Essentially, the insurer gives us their flat fee, and we put a markup for that.

[sharkM 5]
What is the markup?

[entrepreneurH 1]
Our gross utility margin is 50%. It varies from month to month, sometimes we are in 48, sometimes in 51. 50% is the average.

And our net utility margin is between 10% and 14%. Of the 100% of the premiums we have charged, 80% has been paid for cracks.

[sharkM 5]
That's a lot.

[sharkM 5]
It's a lot, isn't it? 

[entrepreneurH 1]
To put it in context, it's 10% higher than cars.

[sharkM 5]
You, Adri, 10 times sales is normal in this industry? Because I think the valuation is very high. 

[sharkM 5]
Yes, I think it's high.

[sharkH 5]
What is your best-selling product? 

[entrepreneurH 1]
Our best-selling product is the Football and Gymnastics Annual. 

[sharkH 5]
Individuals or institutions?

[entrepreneurH 1]
They are schools, normally. Clubs, those who buy us. In football, they are leagues.

[sharkM 5]
Do you have more partners?

[entrepreneurH 1]
No, it's just the two of us. We gave 10% of our company to the collaborators who supported us since 2020. So we are 45-45, and 10% for our collaborators.

[sharkM 5]
I feel that Adri has a lot of experience. But I want to know, Adri, are you going to make an offer?

[sharkH 5]
Before Adri answers, I'm going to make an offer. I'll give you 50% of what you come to look for. For a 7.5% participation. But only if you convince Adriana to join this offer with me.

[sharkM 5]
What do you mean 7.5%?

[sharkH 5]
7.5% participation for 50% of the investment.

[sharkM 5]
We can go half and half, or 10 and 10. 

[sharkM 5]
I don't have much to contribute in this industry. I would love to join, because I think you are going to break it.
I think you have an incredible project. You know your business perfectly. But the good guys for this, the sharks you have to have on your side, are over there.
So I'm out.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Thank you very much. We appreciate it.

[sharkH 5]
I join the Adriana offer. I raise my percentage to 10, just like her. We go for 20% of the investment you come to look for.

[sharkH 5]
It makes a lot of sense for someone who has a sports club. And for someone who knows about insurance. It's not even fair for me to consider another offer.
In my opinion, that's why I'm out.

[sharkH 5]
And an insurer too. I have an insurer.

[sharkH 5]
Also. Well, 

[sharkH 5]
I'm not even talking about it. I'm also out.

[sharkM 5]
If you want to go talk, go ahead. Come to the booth. I hope you don't take too long.

You're not going to leave. 

And they're going to help you a lot.

[sharkH 5]
I like entrepreneurs. They are serious, they understand everything.

[sharkM 5]
What did you think?

[entrepreneurH 1]
We agree that these are the two key players we need to add to our team to reach the next level. I understand the concept of having more involvement, so I don't want to dismiss that. We want to find a middle ground. You initially asked for 15%, then later said 20%. Let's settle in the middle at 17.5% for the same amount of money, the 5 million pesos, but with the guarantee that we can be the insurers of the athletes within your youth academy and beginner training programs

[sharkM 5]
 No, I don't.

[sharkH 5]
It's a condition that I don't know if I can accept right now. I think the offer is very generous.

[sharkM 5]
 Yes.

[sharkH 5]
So I'm not willing to go down.

[sharkM 5]
Me neither. But hey, you're doing it very well. 

[sharkM 5]
Adriana says you're doing it very well, but you're in the tank.
Don't get it wrong.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Yes, and I feel like we're bleeding right now. The sharks already smelled blood.

[sharkM 5]
Okay, so guys, do we have a deal?

[entrepreneurH 1]
Dad, we have a deal. What?
