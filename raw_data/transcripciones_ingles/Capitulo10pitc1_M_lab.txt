Nice to meet you, I'm Renata Sousa, and today I'm going to talk to you about you. Approximately 7 years ago, my nephew Tomas was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. Now, what is type 1 diabetes?

Type 1 diabetes is a medical condition, normally diagnosed in children, in which your body does not produce insulin at all, and therefore cannot process glucose in the correct way. Children with type 1 diabetes depend on insulin to live. At that time, Tomas was only 5 years old, and from one day to the next, his life changed radically.

At the same time, I am studying industrial design, and I am asked to design a toy for children. That's when I decide that I want to design a product for children with type 1 diabetes, something fun, something that excites them, and at the same time helps them manage their condition. After doing a lot of research and interviewing several patients, I identified my design opportunity.

The importance of the rotation of injection areas. What do I mean by this? When you inject insulin into the body, it is crucial to rotate the injection area, but it is very difficult to know where you have already injected.

That is why I created a new concept, temporary tattoos that visually indicate where you have already injected. How do these work? Very simple, the black graph stays on the body, and the colored dots are removed with alcohol prior to each injection.

Just like common temporary tattoos. The plastic is removed, it is applied to the body with a damp cloth. Once the tattoo is on the body, it is pinched to inject into the fat and not into the muscle.

We erase a colored dot and it is injected. After about 3 to 4 days, depending on the patient's insulin dose, the tattoo will no longer have colored dots. This is the indication that you have to choose another tattoo and go back to another injection area.

This is a monthly subscription model, in which the client pays 300 pesos and receives 10 tattoos in mixed exchange. Today I am here to ask for 3.5 million for 5% of the company. They also have tattoos next to them, a set, not 10, but I put a mix of several, of the different areas of the body, so that you can see how a child receives them.

Tell us a little about your sales. 

[entrepreneurM 2]
Now, this is a model that has not been launched. This is a new model, it has only been sold on an internet page.
I created this product about 3 years ago, in which, due to a lack of capital and a personal issue, I put it on pause on one side, but I left the internet page open. 

[sharkM 5]
There is nothing like this in the market? 

[entrepreneurM 2]
Nothing.The closest thing is the extensions.

[sharkH 5]
How many times do they need to be injected?

[entrepreneurM 2]
3 to 6 times a day, depending on the dose of each patient.

[sharkH 5]
And how many stitches does a tattoo bring? 

[entrepreneurM 2]
9, so it lasts for 3 or 4 days. 

[sharkH 5]
So they need 300 pesos a month?

[entrepreneurM 2]
Correct. There are 10 tattoos

[sharkH 5]
If you have 3,300 monthly patients, you would sell 990,000 pesos?

[entrepreneurM 2]
Correct. 

[sharkH 5]
Monthly? 

[entrepreneurM 2]
Monthly, yes.

[sharkH 5]
Why do you need so much money right now?

[entrepreneurM 2]
I need 3.5 million pesos to be able to launch this model that I have as a subscription. Right now, I am the only one, so obviously I also have to grow the team, increase inventory, and obviously marketing, the key marketing campaigns.

[sharkH 5]
But have you ever thought of doing, for example, a test with 10,000 stamps and see?

[entrepreneurM 2]
Right now, with the 3 years that the page has been running, I have sold them. 

[sharkH 5]
How many? 

[entrepreneurM 2]
In 2021, 40,000 tattoos were sold.
It's a very cheap product, but don't take 300 pesos into account. Right now, it's worth 130 pesos because there are 4 tattoos. And in 2022, I only sold 6,000 pesos.
But there's a reason for this. It will only surprise you. But it's because I ran out of inventory and I didn't want to invest a single peso more.
And it was until December of last year, 2022, that I sold more tattoos. And I'm ready. And until now, we have 6,000 pesos.

[sharkM 5]
Hey, Renata, what led you to evaluate your company at 70 million pesos? 

[entrepreneurM 2]
A 7-year annual projection, taking into account my current market, which is only 5% of the market. If you want, I'll give you more or less how these assumptions came about.
In Mexico, obviously. And I did a annual projection, taking into account 3,300 monthly users, which is 5% of the market that I can reach, with net utility at 7 years. 

[sharkM 5]
But then your valuation is what you're going to sell in seven years.

[entrepreneurM 2]
Yes. The value of the product, the reach, and the potential that this product has.

[sharkH 5]
Okay. And you think that this is going to happen? And how do you know that this is the projection that's going to happen?

[entrepreneurM 2]
No, nobody knows. But it could be up or down, right? These are just assumptions.
So it could be bigger or smaller, depending on if we need capital to launch this and see how the market reacts.

[sharkH 5]
Renata, I'm sorry. I have to be a little more brutal. I'm a gringo, so I apologize culturally that when I see something like this, I have to tell you.
In business, you have to go step by step. It's an evolution. It's not a revolution.
You're there a little bit with your head in the sky now, and you have to go back to the ground. So I'm out for that reason.

[entrepreneurM 2]
Understood. Thank you very much. What a more original thing.

[sharkM 5]
What a better idea. It also has a story. And stories always sell.
Everything seemed wonderful to me until I heard your assessment. You have a great market, but your assessment was what got me out of this. For that reason, I'm out.

[sharkM 5]
Thank you. Renata, I'm very sorry about your assessment. I mean, it makes me mad.
It shows that you have a lot of passion for what you do. It shows that you can be a great entrepreneur. The product is great.
It can help a lot of people, not just children. A lot of people. But at the end of the day, right now, it's a project about tattoos.

[entrepreneurM 2]
I understand where you're coming from. I see the potential of this product.

[sharkM 5]
You can't evaluate a company by its potential or future projections. That's a model of a stable company. That's how companies are evaluated.
They have a long history. They have years to prove their income and utility. You don't have that.
You can't evaluate it like that. I'm very sorry, but I'm out.

[entrepreneurM 2]
Thank you. 

[sharkH 5]
Renata, I don't think you're a great entrepreneur. But I do think you have spectacular creativity.

Your assessment is completely prohibitive. And the amount of money you're asking for, including another assessment, would be prohibitive. I'm just going to give you an idea.

Why don't you approach a company that sells diabetes injections and distributes them as part of the drug? But because of the prohibitive amount of money, I have to be out. The good news is that you still have a shark.

[sharkH 5]
I also felt that with your assessment, you told us, look at what I have. And then you said, my friend, it's not up to you. This assessment doesn't invite me.

And you keep talking about the potential. But even so, since you can't stand it, we can't be there. And that's why I think there's so much frustration in the tank with the sharks.

Unfortunately, because of that assessment, although I would have loved to make you an offer, I can't do it right now. I wish you a lot of success. I'm out.
