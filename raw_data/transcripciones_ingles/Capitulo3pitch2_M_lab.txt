Oren was born in mid-2019 with the mission to inspire, accompany and provide tools for Spanish-speaking women to build the life they wanted, a life that they love, that amuses them and makes them feel balanced. How did we do this? With the help of three pillars.

The first is mindset, because your thoughts create your reality. And that's where our first product was born, the Gratitude Diary, with me. The second point is conscious productivity, because to do, first you have to be.

And that's where my philosophy and methodology, Planifeste, was born, which in turn became a life agenda that today has been in the hands of more than 8,000 women. And the third point is self-love. Right in this we empower women to question, to get to know each other, to design the life they want.

In this pillar we have my podcast, a 31-day actionable challenge and lifestyle products that inspire women to work day by day to keep their word with positive habits. Koren was born in mid-2019 and that year we closed with 700,000 in sales. In 2020 we closed sales with 2,700,000.

In 2021 with 6,600,000. And last year we closed sales with 9,500,000. With an average of 30% after taxes.

Today I come to ask you 1,700,000 for the 10% of my company, an evaluation of your activities from last year.

Cecilia, to understand, these books are workbooks so that women reflect on certain aspects of their lives and go carrying diaries and go generating better habits? That gave me the impression that it was, but I'm not 100% sure.

[entrepreneurM 1]
Correct, in fact, you have a box next to you. Marcos and Amaury will surely be able to find someone to give them to. Our most important products are coming.

The Planifesting agendas are a life agenda and the gratitude diaries are an exercise for them to do every morning and every night to dedicate themselves to themselves, to get to know each other, to do introspection and to improve for the next day. Is this Cecilia? That's right.

Hey Ceci, I understand the mission very well. Why doesn't your methodology work for men?

[entrepreneurM 1]
It works completely for them. However, precisely in this process of growing the model, I decided to take a little out of it to be able to put all my efforts into it. It is quite complicated to do it for both and I wanted to specify something.

[sharkM 2]
Ceci, I want to understand by product how your revenue is divided.

[entrepreneurM 1]
Look, our strongest revenue comes from the physical part, where 40% are the agendas. The gratitude diary represents about 18-20% and the rest of the products, the rest. Currently, my market still does not replace the physical, however, already right now it was positioned at the end of last year, 5% of the digital agendas within all my revenue.

How much do you expect to sell this year, Cecilia?

[entrepreneurM 1]
Fourteen and a half million.

[sharkM 5]
Wow, you speak very fast, I like that. 

[sharkM 6]
Oh, think fast, that's better.

What does OREM mean?

[entrepreneurM 1]
OREM is an acronym. The O means pride, which for me is that any person in this life has to have pride and recognition of who he is. The R is resilience, the E is focus and the M is motivation, remembering to always have that passion.

What is the conversion rate, the acquisition cost and the repurchase rate?

[entrepreneurM 1]
The repurchase rate is 18%, the acquisition cost varies between 250 and 270, more or less, and the conversion rate is between 2.5 and 3%.

[sharkM 2]
And last year, did you earn three million pesos already from EBITDA?

[entrepreneurM 1]
Two million nine hundred.

[sharkM 2]
We have very good utility, good numbers in general, minus the repurchase rate.

[entrepreneurM 1]
I promise you that we can do a lot of cool things.

[sharkH 3]
Okay, let me think about it a little.

[sharkM 5]
Thank you. Cecilia, the product was amazing and you are a super entrepreneur. I love this, it's usually what entrepreneurs and entrepreneurs look for, but I'm not the shark for you, so I'm out.

[entrepreneurM 1]
Thank you very much.

[sharkM 4]
Cecilia, my methodology of promoting this, that we promote the same philosophy, is different. I feel that you don't need the capital. That's why I'm out, but with pleasure, I give you an award because it seems to me that you have a great passion for the same thing that I promote.

[entrepreneurM 1]
Thank you very much, Marisa, I really appreciate that.

[sharkH 3]
I think you can do very well giving talks. I think there are many women in Mexico and Latin America who need your help. You have a podcast, you have a methodology, you have products.

Even most people who are in this industry start the other way around. They start giving talks and then they make their brand and their product. You already have all that.

And also, listening to you and seeing you, I think you have a great ease of communication and I think you could do very well in that. If one day you want some advice from me, with pleasure, I give a lot of talks, I could give you a couple more tips. I don't get as much creativity in relation to your products.

Unfortunately, for this occasion, I'm out.

[entrepreneurM 1]
Thank you very much.

[sharkM 2]
Let's see, I see a great future for Planifesto. I imagine it as a platform for courses, as a digital app, you as the great influencer and the big face. But, I get a lot of energy and it worries me a lot that only 5% of your sales today are on a digital topic.

I would have loved for you to come here and say that 30% of my sales are already digital and I'm getting further and further away from my role. I invite you to dedicate 80% of your time to think about that. For now, I'm out.

[entrepreneurM 1]
Thank you very much.

[sharkH 3]
Good luck.
