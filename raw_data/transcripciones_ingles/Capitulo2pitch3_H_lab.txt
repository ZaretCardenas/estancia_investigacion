Today we want to start with you with a question. Sharks, how many clothes do you have in your closets that you don't use? Well, let me tell you that according to several studies, approximately 50% of the clothes we have in our closets have not been used in the last six months.

Today we are here, my partner Alex and I, José Manuel, to present you SOCA, the first unlimited closet in the world. In SOCA, what we want to do is create a more sustainable and accessible future for humanity and today we make it possible through this unlimited closet and probably the dream of many people.

Sharks, when we talk about fashion, there is a problem with the issue of production. For example, these pants are used to produce 7,000 to 10,000 liters of water. How many clothes do we not have that we do not use?

[entrepreneurH 1]
And well, I tell you now how SOCA works. Very simple. Unlike other platforms, we do not buy and do not sell clothes.

What we do is exchange them through our points system. The way we make money is also very simple. We charge a fixed service fee at the end of each order or through our monthly subscription and our points recharge.

[entrepreneurH 2]
We are asking for 750,000 pesos for 3% of the company. Thank you very much, sharks.

[sharkM 7]
It's the name of where it came from, SOCA?.

[entrepreneurH 1]
We believe that we live in a system in which we want to involve people and we want to change these resources that currently exist and contaminate and then we want to create a more social capitalism. And that's the name of the project. Social Capitalism, SOCA.

How did you meet?

[entrepreneurH 1]
Alex was my university professor. We met in the last subject of the degree and not because he is here, but I can say that he was the best professor I had in the degree and it was from there that the relationship began to grow and with this desire to start, I started SOCA and it was that Alex also began to mentor me.

[sharMk 3]
What material did you give him? It was not a valuation of companies, it is clear.

[entrepreneurH 2]
No, it was connections.

[sharkH 4]
How much is the equivalence of a point to a peso more or less?

[entrepreneurH 1]
Very good question. There is no equivalence as such in money, but if we could say it, it is around 2 or 3 pesos. 

[sharkH 4]
I mean, is there an equivalence

[entrepreneurH 2]
Yes, not exactly, but there is an equivalence.

[sharkH 8]
How many garments, just to give you an idea of ​​the universe you already have, how many garments do you have right now in warehouse? 

[entrepreneurH 2]
We currently have on platform 2,000.
We have in warehouse that we have not raised the whole platform to around 400 more and the idea is that at the end of the day it is second hand, but it is fashion.

[sharkM 3]
All very well, but they are valuing their company at 25 million pesos. Why?

[entrepreneurH 1]
Well, we know that this valuation involves many factors. In our case, it is the industry. We are a very attractive industry that is growing a lot.

For 2026, only North America is projected to grow 82 in 82 billion dollars.

[sharkM 3]
But that is the industry.

[sharkH 1]
Yes. How much have you sold?

[entrepreneurH 2]
We have a first platform. This first platform allowed us to sell 470 orders last year. We sent it to more than 12 cities in Mexico and the sales were 180,000 pesos.

[sharkM 3]
I am still lost in the valuation. They need the 750,000 pesos.

[entrepreneurH 2]
Let's see, there you go. Yes, and there you go. Why?

The first answer is to get more into the technology part. We have an internet page. We want to develop an application that also has artificial intelligence to be able to better identify the points for the orders I want to send and so on.

[sharkM 3]
But it will not reach them with 750,000 pesos. Yes, right?

[sharkH 4]
The ambitious valuation of this type, in addition to having much greater validation and so on, would have to be a platform that is probably much more technological and much more scalable. And they are going to start facing growth problems. That is number one.

Number two, this is not a new model. And everyone has gotten into a problem, which is my third point, which is the currency they are generating. Because at the end of the day, a change currency is enough.

And I am out. 

[entrepreneurH 2]
Thank you, Marcos. Thank you, Marcos.

[sharkM 7]
I don't like the name. It doesn't catch my attention. It doesn't tell me what a business is about.

[entrepreneurH 5]
That's why I'm here. Thank you, Marcos. Thank you.

[sharkH 7]
Alex, José Manuel. I would have to be very aggressive with you, to really be comfortable feeling that you are inviting me as a partner. And the reality is that the only problem when you are very aggressive is that it seems that this bond is not being formed, of we are going to build this together.

And for those reasons, I am out. 

[sharkM 3]
I think that in this case it is still a social project and not a profitable project with growth that can be seen in the future. I'm very sorry, but I'm out.

[sharkH 6]
I do see a lot of potential in this. But I really think that if they continue like this, they are going to face a lot of problems when it comes to growth, they are going to have to grow the infrastructure, they are going to have to have very large warehouses. The issue of peaking to be able to supply these products is still something very green.

That's why I'm out. But we'll talk about it later.

[entrepreneurH 2]
We would love it if you could open the doors for us to look for these conversations and follow up with you.

[sharkM 7]
Of course. Count on me.

[entrepreneurH 2]
And I hope that soon we will see each other.

[sharkM 3]
Count on me for a conversation and continue to support them in whatever way I can.

[entrepreneurH 2]
Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very much.
