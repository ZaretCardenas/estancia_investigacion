My name is Renato Cortés. And Escarla López. And we are Felipe with Tennis.

A company specialized in products for cleaning and maintenance of tennis. Our line of products contains four specialized brushes for the different areas and materials of the tennis, a pain remover to keep the tennis always fresh inside, and a shampoo made from natural soaps and oils that help us clean and maintain the tennis, preventing it from scratching and oxidizing.

[entrepreneurM 1]
The development of the brand and the products lasted approximately two years. During this time, we realized that the key was to find a formula that was super good to eliminate dirt and at the same time very careful with the materials. Once we found that formula, we knew we were ready.

Currently, we have been in the market for a year and a half and we have become known through entrepreneurship fairs. We also already have wholesale sales in specialized laundromats. And we have online sales through our website and e-commerce platforms.

The support we are asking for is 700,000 pesos, offering 30% of our company.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Before the questions, do you want me to explain how our products work? Of course. Great.
Do you want to approach someone to see how it works?

[sharkH 6]
Litch, you are the youngest.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Before washing, I always recommend that you identify the tennis materials to know which brushes we are going to use.

[sharkM 6]
I also want to see.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Great. And each of these brushes is used for different areas. This is the soft brush for delicate materials, Ante, Gamusa, Nobu.

The versatile brush for more resistant materials, leather, canvas, vinyl. The underground brush for  Megazuela. This is the hardest of all for this area.

And a rubber band for dry cleaning of Ante, Gamusa and Nobu. For the type of materials that are the most delicate. I'm going to put a little shampoo in a bowl with water.

A few drips.

[sharkH 6]
You always have to dilute it like this in water?

[Orador 2]
A little water. And we remove the excess foam with the help of the microfiber. 

[sharkH 6]
It's good, huh?

[entrepreneurH 1]
And something really cool is that the tennis lasts a lot longer because you are giving them maintenance. You are not just cleaning them.

[sharkH 6]
Once after the soap, do you have to add something else?

[entrepreneurM 1]
No.

[sharkH 6]
With the same soap, so that it stays.

[entrepreneurM 1]
Yes, there are the lubricants that make it not crack. Unlike the domestic use detergents, which is what people regularly use to wash their shoes, those dry out a lot and that makes them crack and last less, seeing them as new.

[sharkH 6]
I think it's a great, great product. 

[entrepreneurM 1]
Thank you very much. 

[sharkH 6]
Is the complete kit sold or is it sold separately?

[entrepreneurM 1]
The kit is assembled by the person who is going to buy it according to their needs. You can only buy the shampoo. You can buy the shampoo with a brush, with two, or the most complete kit.
It depends on what the person needs.

[sharkH 6]
And did you patent the formula?

[entrepreneurM 1]
We developed the formula together with a laboratory and we have a Maquila exclusivity with it.

[sharkH 6]
Ok, you can't sell it to anyone else?

[entrepreneurM 1]
No.

[sharkH 6]
Carla, before you start asking about numbers and things like that, I am very intrigued by the name of the company.

[entrepreneurM 1]
Felipe Con tenis is a very Chilanga phrase. I am from Guadalajara.

[entrepreneurH 1]
It means happy and happy.

[sharkM 6]
Haven't you heard that expression? Many times they tell you, how are you? Felipe Con tenis.

Feliz y contento. Yes, that is the meaning.

[sharkH 6]
Now, let's talk about the business. How much have you sold in the last year?

[entrepreneurM 1]
In the last year we sold 400,000 pesos. 

[sharkM 6]
What is the gross margin that you have in your products?

[entrepreneurM 1]
The gross margin is 52% and we have a net margin of approximately 17-18%.

[sharkH 6]
And with this 700,000 pesos, what would you do with this money?

[entrepreneurM 1]
We want to allocate a good part to a good digital marketing strategy.

[sharkH 6]
How are your social networks right now? 

[entrepreneurH 1]
We have approximately 5,000 followers. 

[sharkH 6]
And have you evaluated how many people have bought you through your social networks?

[entrepreneurM 1]
More or less. We also have a website and we sell on e-commerce platforms. We don't know how those people got there, but through Instagram, they contact us directly.
I think about 15% more or less.

[sharkH 6]
About sales in general?

[entrepreneurM 1]
Yes.

[sharkH 6]
Do you run the company?

[entrepreneurM 1]
Between the two of us. Everyone is in their area.

[entrepreneurH 1]
She is in charge of the numbers and financial issues. I am in charge of image, communication, branding.

[sharkH 6]
Full time, both of you?

[entrepreneurH 1]
At the moment, no. That is why we are looking for that support, so that we can dedicate ourselves full time and give it that punch and get very far with Felipe.

[sharkH 6]
And would you both give up if this business went well?

[entrepreneurM 1]
Totally.

[sharkM 6]
Do you already have a company? Or how are you operating right now?

[entrepreneurM 1]
The company is already set up. Is the brand registered? Totally.

[sharkH 6]
And how do you see this projection for 2023? How much do you plan to sell?

[entrepreneurM 1]
Well, look, we bring a growth of about 33%.

[sharkH 6]
Monthly?

[entrepreneurM 1]
I got it like this. I don't know. I'm not a financier, but I got it like this.

[sharkH 6]
But you're the one with the numbers.

[entrepreneurM 1]
For 20 months, I divided the first 10 months how much we sold and the second 10 months how much we sold. And there is a growth of 32, 33%. So, based on that, on that number, I feel that it is conservative because we are already having a lot of repurchase and we are entering more or less in specialized laundromats, those that are giving us good volume.

[sharkH 6]
They say they already have repurchase. How does that look? How often are they repurchasing them?

[entrepreneurM 1]
Like every three months approximately. Well, it depends a lot on how much people use the product, but yes.

[sharkH 6]
Well, this is going to last me a month. 

[sharkH 6]
Renato, Carla, I'm going to tell you where I am.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Tell me.

[sharkH 6]
I liked it, I liked the brand, I liked the product. I think you complement each other very well. The only problem I see is that you came with a very high valuation.

In other words, even growing by 30% a couple of years, you don't get to make the company worth this. And that's why I'm out.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Ok. Ok. 

[sharkH 6]
Hey, I also want to tell you that it is not an industry that I am passionate about and I don't see myself getting into it fully either.
Therefore, so as not to hinder and hopefully receive another offer, I am out.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Thank you.

[sharkM 6]
Not even asking for 50% of the company, we would reach a fair valuation. Unfortunately, I love the product, but with that valuation, you left me out.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Thank you very much.

[sharkH 6]
The truth is that not only did you arrive with a very high valuation, you came offering too much of the company. If today we punish you for that valuation and we are left with half of the company, I could not do it to you and that is why I am out.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Thank you very much.

[sharkH 6]
I loved you as entrepreneurs, it is seen that you are very passionate about this. I don't know, I'm thinking. I am going to offer you the 700,000 pesos that you come to ask for, but for 49% of the company.

And also, we are going to need 3% of gifts. Once I recover my money, the 700,000 pesos, I will return the 19 to keep the original offer, which is 30. And I go down from 3% of the sale, I go down 1.5%. 

[entrepreneurM 1]
Ok.

[entrepreneurH 1]
What do you think? 

[sharkH 6]
Do we have a deal?

[entrepreneurM 1]
Yes, we have a deal.
