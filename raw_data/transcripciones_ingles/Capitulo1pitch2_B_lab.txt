My name is Jain Som, CEO and co-founder of Blind Creator.

[entrepreneurM 2]
Hi, I'm Desiree Hern√°ndez, co-founder and operations director.

[entrepreneurH 2]
Since 2019, I've been building technology to help content creators monetize their audiences.

[entrepreneurM 2]
After talking to hundreds of content creators, we realized that their main problem is that they don't know how to manage their business.

[entrepreneurH 2]
Managing a digital business is difficult, and as the audience grows, content creators face problems ranging from defining their fees to managing their accounts to charge. That's why, at Blind Creator, we started with a solution where creators can find out how much they can charge for their audiences based on their social media engagements. In our software, we also have a platform where they can manage their clients and they can sell and offer their products and services digitally.

This software is connected to a financial solution that we call the Creator Bank, where we centralize all of the creator's income from all of their different monetization sources, and we give them an option so they can review their accounts to charge, and they never forget to charge their clients.

[entrepreneurM 2]
With just four months of operation, we have generated $120,000, with an average net utility of 12%. There are content creators who have trusted us and we have been able to help them increase their sales by up to 60%. We are here looking for strategic partners who can help us enhance our opportunity and maintain our growth rate.

We are looking for $4 million for 5% of our company to continue developing technology that helps content creators take their business to the next level. Sharks, who is ready to revolutionize and professionalize influencer marketing with Blind Creators?

[entrepreneurH 2]
Sharks, we did an analysis of your social media. You will find an envelope where you can see how much you could charge for publications using your social media.

[sharkM 5]
While we see this, tell us, do you charge for selling this software once? Do these creators pay monthly? How do you make money?

How do you earn?

[entrepreneurM 1]
This is recurring for collaboration. The microsite helps the creator have their statistics in real time and the brands that are interested in them can also have access to that and can know their rates.

[sharkM 5]
How much and how much do you charge content creators?

[entrepreneurM 1]
Let's say a collaboration is in $500, I charge the content creator 10% to help him manage everything. From charging the client, billing, that he has the wallet, and that he can dispose of his income on any account he decides.

[sharkM 5]
Let's see, Marisa, how much can you earn?

[sharkM 5]
Oh, wait a minute, per year? $36,000.

[sharkM 5]
You? Come on!

[sharkH 5]
$7 million.

[sharkH 5]
I'm at $47,000 per year.

[sharkM 5]
Come on! And you, Ale? $34,500.

[sharkM 5]
Well, same as me.

[sharkM 5]
Brian, how much can you earn per year?

[sharkH 5]
Well, unlimited here.$1,000.

But I think I'm going to survive with this for a few thousand dollars. I see here that everyone is on Instagram. They only chose Instagram to have a cooperative here.

They do it with all the platforms that exist and only to have any platform, LinkedIn, Twitter, TikTok, it works with everything.

[entrepreneurH 1]
It doesn't work with everything right now. It currently works with Instagram and TikTok. Okay.
But we do want to be on all the platforms that are most relevant for content creators. 

[sharkH 5]
But the analysis you did was just the first one? 

[entrepreneurH 1]
Well, just the first one, correct.

[sharkH 5]
The technology is 100% of you?

[entrepreneurH 1]
100% of us. 

[sharkH 5]
Developed by you 100%? 

[entrepreneurH 1]
Yes.

[sharkH 5]
And competitors? 

[entrepreneurH 1]
There are competitors to solve specific problems. For example, there are platforms to help monetize digital products.

What we are doing is consolidating different solutions to solve all the problems in one place.


[sharkM 5]
How long have you been doing this, developing this platform? And if you already have any external investment, apart from what you have invested.

[entrepreneurH 1]
We have been doing this for four months since we started the business. And we are investing around $10,000 a month. Our own capital, mainly.
And we have some friends and family members who have trusted the business.

[sharkH 5]
How are you attracting influencers to your platform?

[entrepreneurM 1]
Well, we have been in the market for about three years, working with content creators and artists. So it is very easy to reach them. We already have experience.

That's what supports us the most. Nowadays we have content creators who reach more than 800,000 accounts. 60% are from their followers.

40% are accounts that are not followed and generate up to 5,000 downloads in 24 hours. And of those, at least 30% become clients.

[sharkM 5]
To better understand your platform and what you do, you also have that relationship with the people, the companies that are looking for influencers. Yes. So the influencer doesn't have to worry about looking for who pays for an ad, who pays for a publication.

You make the link for those people. 

[entrepreneurM 1]
Exactly. Correct.

[sharkH 5]
How do you think I could help you? Well, I think you have the most impressive entrepreneur community in Latin America. One of the strongest networks in the startup ecosystem in Latin America.

[sharkM 5]
Amaury and Marisa, I think I know who they came for.

[sharkM 5]
You are great entrepreneurs. They know the area they are working in very well. I am not an expert in this area and for that reason I am out.

Thank you very much.

[sharkH 5]
Let me tell you where I stand with you. I think you have a very interesting product. A technology that could be a disruptor of the industry.

I think you are on the right track. You catch my curiosity and interest. But for me, I think you are arriving a little earlier to be able to have more results for such a high valuation.

I am out. Thank you very much.

[entrepreneurM 1]
Thank you very much, Amaury.

[sharkH 5]
Can I make you an offer? 

[entrepreneurM 1]
Yes. 

[sharkH 5]
The offer would be what you are asking for, but I would use 10% of the company.

[sharkM 5]
Brian, would you be willing to make this offer together for 10%, you and me, half and half?

[sharkH 5]
What is the minimum equity that you would be willing to enter? Because for me, to get up in bed, I think about 7% for me.

[sharkM 5]
So you don't want 5-5?

[sharkH 5]
I think that since I will be carrying a lot of work, if you are not willing to change that 5, then I think it would be better to stick with the 10.

[sharkH 5]
I will make you the same offer, but I do carry a part of the weight of the next operation, and of the part of technology, and of the part of community, entrepreneurs. 

[sharkH 5]
So you want to split it?

[sharkH 5]
5-5. 

[sharkH 5]
I am willing to enter with Ale for 7% me and 3% her. And Marcus, 5% and 5%.

[entrepreneurH 1]
And an offer of the three, wouldn't you like it?

[sharkH 5]
I don't. I don't think there are three in this boat. Okay.

[sharkM 5]
The ball is in his court. 

[sharkM 5]
Very good entrepreneurs.

[entrepreneurM 1]
Thank you for your offers. We would like to offer you...
We really like Ale's duet with Brian. And we are willing to give Ale another 1% so that she can promise that with us she is a little more fair to her.

[sharkM 5]
They do see my value, you see?

[sharkH 5]
I saw, I saw. 

[sharkH 5]
Look, we're on the same team. A deal.

[entrepreneurH 1]
We have a deal
