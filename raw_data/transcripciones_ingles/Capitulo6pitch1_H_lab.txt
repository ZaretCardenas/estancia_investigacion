I am Jorge Lizardi. We are cousins and founders of Verde Compacto. Did you know that by 2026, urban vertical agriculture will have a value of 10 billion dollars?

And will it be key to feed the population of the largest cities in the world? Well, this will lead to three main problems. 80% of the water consumed globally goes to agriculture, but more than half is wasted.

Food distribution chains are very complex, very inefficient and very fragile. And also, due to climate change, only in the Mexican countryside enough food is lost to supply the entire metropolitan area of ​​Monterrey. That is why our mission at Verde Compacto is to develop technology to produce more food with fewer resources, anywhere in the world and at any time of the year.

[entrepreneurH 1]
How do we do it? We design vertical hydroponics farms in a totally controlled environment where they are installed in closed spaces such as a building, a winery or a ship container with zero waste of water. And the best of all is that this can produce 365 days a year.

In 2019 we launched the Hopster. This Hopster is the standard farm that we have designed within a ship container, the Plug and Play system, where in 30 square meters you can produce the equivalent in a year to 5,000 square meters in the open air.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Since 2019 we have sold more than 16 million pesos. And the businesses that we are closing today have a potential to generate 200 million pesos in the next three years. We invite you to invest two million pesos or 5% of our price.

How easy is it to cultivate them? I want to know how complex it is to take care of and have 40 or 50 meters of what you have.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Indoor farms have everything practically automated. That is, in all the climate, as you can see on the screen, it is a central computer that controls the temperature, humidity, CO2, everything automatically so that it is easier to produce and that the plants are always checked.

Jorge, tell me a little bit about the cost. For example, a container. How does the person who grows there recover the money they invested?

[entrepreneurH 1]
Very good question. This system has a starting price of two million pesos. The client has to, according to our recommendation, adapt the space where he is going to install it.

How does he recover his investment? He has to start doing his market study because in the end it is a business what are they going to produce? They can be one, two, five varieties.

What price are they going to sell them? And obviously we already with the simulator tell them what cost they are going to have. So more or less, depending on all that, the return on investment time can be between two and a half years or up to four years, depending on your business model.

[sharkH 5]
Who is that client? What is the profile of that client who buys that product?

[entrepreneurH 1]
We are currently focusing on B2B corporations that self-consume food or commercialize food and that are mainly located in complex logistics areas, that is, it costs them a lot of work to bring the product to that one, that it is very expensive for them to buy it or that it is impossible to produce.

[sharkH 5]
Can you tell us about a successful case?

[entrepreneurH 1]
The director of a resort that they are opening in French Polynesia, in a private island, tells us that it costs us a lot of work to bring fresh products. It is a top-level resort. We already put together a project to measure with three containers, and the containers were sent there.

We went, installed them, trained them and practically until today they continue to work and they continue to harvest the products from those containers.

[sharkM 5]
Juan and Jorge, this is a cultivation system that already exists in many parts of the world and that many companies do. Why are you different?

[entrepreneurH 1]
We decided to focus our company on developing technology to maintain the same levels of productivity as what is out there, but lowering initial capital costs. For that, we applied the technology in different configurations and scales. We also sell seeds, nutrients, inputs for the farms.

We also sell them and all the refractions.

[sharkH 5]
Juan, Jorge, let me ask you something. What do you expect from a shark?

[entrepreneurH 1]
An experience that they can donate to the Board of Directors, to the Advisory Board and add to what we have.

[sharkH 5]
I think that from the description and also observing where they were looking when they were explaining who they wanted, they didn't look at me much. And for reasons that make sense. I'm not super connected to that industry.

I think there may be better sharks in this business. So I'm out for that. Good luck.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Thank you very much.

[sharkM 5]
I don't know. I'm not sure if I would venture to change the foods I currently consume for some that I produce without really knowing if I'm going to have that same quality.

[entrepreneurH 1]
The quality here is really superior because the plants are always in optimal conditions of climate nutrition. We have laboratory analysis. Even the organoleptic characteristics are superior to what we find in supermarkets.

[sharkM 5]
Interesting.

[sharkH 5]
Juan, Jorge, I think this is the feeding of the future. I love this. I love this world.
This vision of this world fascinates me. And I would like to enter a business of mine for the first time. And I'm going to make an offer.
For what you're looking for, two million pesos, but I want 13% participation.

[sharkM 5]
I want to applaud you for how versatile you've been. I remember when I heard you adapt at the beginning, I remember when you talked to me and said, Marisa, make me a chocolate cake, but with strawberry in the middle, and you bathe it with cajeta, and you put the decoration in pink. I said yes to everything.

Over time, obviously, you standardize yourself and you have the ability to produce in bulk and you don't do those favors anymore. But at the beginning, it's always important to be adaptable and versatile. I congratulate you on that.

And I don't have a better profile than this shark I just offered you. And for that reason, I'm out. 

[entrepreneurH 1]
Thank you very much, Marisa.

[sharkH 5]
I think it's a very important business. I also want to make you an offer. You're subject to validation of some things.
Of course, of course. I love the model, and I offer you two million for 10%.

[sharkM 5]
I love being in the tank, because not only do entrepreneurs learn, but we sharks learn too. The truth is that I don't know much about the system. I want to start exploring it.
I would love to continue talking to you, but for the moment, I'm not going to make you an offer. I'm out, but I wish you a lot of success.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Thank you very much. It was a pleasure talking to you. 

[sharkH 5]

I'm going to modify my proposal.
I'm going to go down 10% like Marcus, but I'm also going to invite Alejandra to be an advisor with me. What interests me is that people like Ale, successful entrepreneurs with a business in the food industry, can also add a vision to the future. So if you agree, Ale, I invite you to be part of Advisor with me on this.

Sure. But I put the investment for 10%.

[sharkM 5]
How's the mini-tank? Well, thank you. You're smiling.

[entrepreneurH 1]
What we've decided, we're going to take Maury's proposal with the investment and the percentage and with this Ale as an advisory board, both of us. Jorge, Juan, do we have a deal?

[sharkH 5]
Yes, of course.
