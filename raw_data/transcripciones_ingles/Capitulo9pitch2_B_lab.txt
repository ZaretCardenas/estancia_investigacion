How are you? We are Raúl Ezez and Raquel Levy. Today we have a question for you.

[entrepreneurM 1]
What is your favorite game of your little sharks at home? As parents of two, we know that one day they want to play house, in the cave, with the cushions of the living room. The next day they have so much energy that they destroy everything that is within their reach.

They jump, they run, they throw marometas.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Dundy falls into the category of Open Play, which means that the game has no borders. The limits of the game are set by the children themselves. It generates spaces of interaction and coexistence with the parents, and also grows together with the children.

[entrepreneurM 1]
A baby uses Dundy to be on the floor. What helps him to be on the floor? To be upside down.

He can start spinning, crawling, walking in a safe space. A smaller child who starts with a role-playing game can imagine that he is in a boat and he is a pirate, or that he is in a castle, or that he is a dragon and that they have to destroy him. And a bigger child starts doing his challenges, and then he can run, jump, jump, throw marometas, destroy.

The children become the architects of their own toys. The best of all is that by the end of the day of the games, everything returns to the form of a sofá.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Dundee is a 100% Mexican brand focused on creating spaces of development and play for young people. And in the two and a half years that we have of life, there are more than 3,000 houses that already have Dundee in their homes, in Mexico and in the United States. Today we came to ask for 1,200,000 pesos for 10% of our company.

[entrepreneurM 1]
We would love to invite you to make a dynamic, to make teams, and that you have to build the most creative shark tank you can.

[sharkM 5]
Well, Lichi and I against you.

[sharkH 5]
How much is the public price? 

[entrepreneurM 1]
Dundee Classic 5,490 plus 6,490, Play 8,490.

[sharkH 5]
And is it in relation to the market of this industry?

[entrepreneurH 1]
The concept exists in the United States, and we move with the same types of prices. In Mexico we do not have direct competition, and particularly with what we would be competing with is with furniture for playgrounds, or furniture for children's bedrooms.

[entrepreneurM 1]
The cool thing about this is that it really allows you so many possibilities that children do not get bored.

[sharkM 5]
Well, Raúl and Raquel, this looks very cool, but how long does this last?

[entrepreneurH 1]
We have zero incidence, and the raw material we use is tapestry and armchairs. So the same thing that lasts a 10, 15-year-old armchair is what this material can last you.

[sharkM 5]
Tell me, what are your sales from last year?

[entrepreneurH 1]
Last year we made 6 million pesos. In 2021 as well.

[sharkM 5]
Why didn't you grow from 2021 to 2022?

[entrepreneurH 1]
Our initial commercialization model was through digital channels. We were born in a pandemic, so we had our own website and our own website in the United States. In 2022, consumption habits change radically, and we drop the online part.

We are looking for strategies to reach the numbers of 2021 and 2022.

[sharkH 5]
Compared to your prices against the United States, in the United States I imagine you are much cheaper, right? 

[entrepreneurH 1]
We are cheaper, yes. 

[sharkH 5]
How much?

[entrepreneurH 1]
Not so much, 10% cheaper. 

[sharkH 5]
10%? 

[entrepreneurH 1]
Yes.

[sharkH 5]
At this stage of your business, what are the Sharks looking for?

[entrepreneurH 1]
We believe that a strategic partner, precisely to be able to scale. The product meets, the reviews are extraordinary, we have a low incidence rate of 1%, the returns are counted, the product meets. We are missing growth .

[sharkH 5]
I just have a very direct and very honest question.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Come on. 

[sharkH 5]
Why the valuation? You didn't grow in sales, you are doing a valuation of two times your sales, without growth.

[entrepreneurH 1]
If there is no growth, it makes no sense, none of what we are doing here. Sales of this year of 9 million pesos are being projected. We have a product that is opening doors in a retail channel for 2024, that alone that product can reach 10 million pesos of valuation.

The reality is that with the history we have previously, the valuation is high. With what we managed to glimpse that there is a future, the valuation is low.

[sharkM 5]
I think you really have a lot of opportunity for growth, as you have said. It is seen that you know the product very well. I don't think this is something I can help with.
The truth, and for that reason, I am out.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Thank you very much. 

[sharkH 5]
Look, I really loved this. I think it is something that can grow.

I have three children, so I think it's cool, because they can play, they can make many ideas, put them into practice. What scares me is what is not so scalable, and the fact that they can copy it very easily. So for that reason, I am out.

But I wish you a lot of success. 

[entrepreneurH 1]
Thank you very much.

[sharkH 5]
Raúl, Raquel, I think you have a good product. I'm not ready to say if I'm out or give you an offer, because I think it can be something that can grow. But my doubt is that I don't know the industry, so I don't know what I can add to it.


[sharkH 5]
You know, something very similar happens to me to what Mauri said. I normally invest in entrepreneurs, and you are great entrepreneurs. I'm a little scared of the industry and the product, but what scares me the most is that they will have to sell, I imagine, many more things outside of online.

In stores, with distribution, etc. And they don't give me the margins.

[entrepreneurH 1]
It is the one that is operating, which is 30% for the distributor. It is a model without inventory costs, without logistical costs and so on. They display the Dundee on their sales floor, and if a sale is generated, we are in charge of all the logistics to deliver it to the client.

It is not a majority market, it is a market more of grabbing and fishing distributors, 50 or 100 distributors at the republic level, and then that adds up. But it's not knocking on the door of a great retailer and saying...

[sharkM 5]
I think it's very cool, but for some reason I'm not convinced. And I'm going to listen to my intuition, I'm going to stay out, but I'm going to be your client, and I promise you, I'm going to buy several of your products for my libraries.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Thank you very much. 

[sharkH 5]
Raúl, Raquel, you just said something, Raúl, that I think that's where I ended up making my decision. You said it's not a matter of distributors.
That makes me understand that I don't know anything about this industry in particular. It's an industry that I don't know, I don't feel comfortable telling you, I'm going to help you with this, we're going to do this together, and I think that's what you need or what you came to look for, and for those reasons I wish you a lot of success, but I'm out.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Thank you very much.

[sharkH 5]
Thank you.

[sharkH 5]
It's hard for me to say this, but you know what? I agree.
I also think it's a business of distributors. I lack knowledge of the industry. I would love to revisit it.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Okay.

[sharkH 5]
And that's why I'm out.
