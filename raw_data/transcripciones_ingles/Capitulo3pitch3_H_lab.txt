My name is Daniel Piceno, and now I want to talk about what we do at QUIL, Sustainable Writing, and all the impact we make on society and the planet. All this started when your server was a student in the state of Guanajuato, and they asked me in high school to do a project that had a positive impact on the environment, that generated awareness, and that also generated a great impact. Today, we generate and develop Sustainable Writing at QUIL.

We make pencils, colors, and pens, and also with circular economy. I want to show you what our audience likes the most, and it's the pencils that are planted, that are planted this way, okay? With them, you can make an urban garden that generates an impact on health.

As if that were not enough, they are compostable. When you take the tip out, they become compostable because it is cellulose paper and nothing is thrown away. The most important and favorite thing for your server are the colors, since I love to draw, but if you wet the tip of the colors, they become water-soluble.

You can see perfectly here as a mark when you wet the tip, okay? Next, I want to introduce you to the crown jewel, because the crown jewel involved the artistic part, the artisanal part, the sustainable part. This is the collection of pre-Hispanic cultures.

Are you ready? This is what we do. Here comes the most sustainable pen in the world, the one with the least plastic, a pencil that does not carry any metal, which is the one next to it, a bamboo brush, and a pencil that is planted.

We want you to do mancuerna with us, and that in exchange for 300,000 pesos, you can have a 7% participation. We are looking for a strategic partner, but above all, that he has a green heart.

Thank you, Daniel. Tell us a little bit about your sales. 

[entrepreneurH 1]
Sure.

[sharkH 4]
Please remind me what year you started your business, and if you can tell us the sales since the year you started.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Sure. The idea started when I was in high school, and it's been 12 years. However, the constitution of the project, since 2016, the sales of the previous year were 3.1 million pesos. Can you give us another year, 2021? Yes, in 2021, 1 million, well, 1.1. There was a growth of 200%. Wow!

[sharkH 4]
How much are you going to sell this year? 

[entrepreneurH 1]
We have a projection, Marcus, of 60%. 

[sharkH 4]
4.3 million? 

[entrepreneurH 1]
Approximately. 

[sharkM 4]
And, Daniel, where do you manufacture them? 

[entrepreneurH 1]
We manufacture them in the state of Guanajuato.

We have a factory in Le√≥n, Guanajuato, and distribution in Irapuato, Guanajuato. 

[sharkM 4]
And your installed capacity? 

[entrepreneurH 1]
The installed capacity has been growing very fast, because before we produced a pencil between 48 and 52 hours.Due to the drying process, due to the process that leads to the circular economy, today we are producing 144,000 pencils monthly.

[sharkM 3]
Why are you spraying your brand? Why does this, which is the crown jewel, not have the same brand as this?

[entrepreneurH 1]
Quill is the general line, the school line, which is the massive one, and that is the art line. 

[sharkH 3]
But it doesn't say by Quill or anything? 

[entrepreneurH 1]
We don't have it yet, but it's by Quill, obviously.Inside there is a label that says by Quill. 

[sharkH 3]
What does Quill mean? 

[entrepreneurH 1]
Quill means, and comes from the word, to write in Nahuatl.

[sharkM 3]
What percentage of your sales come from the school line versus the premium line?

[entrepreneurH 1]
From the school line, it's basically 70%, and from the premium line, 30%.

[sharkH 4]
Daniel, tell me, what do you visualize? What are you looking for today? What do you need?

Why are you here at the Tank?

[entrepreneurH 1]
Well, first of all, he's a strategic partner. I think there's a lot to learn. When we touch the doors of big corporations that are dedicated to the paper industry, they like it.

However, you have to have a strong team for this to go well. And above all, in other channels worldwide, which have also approached, I think we need a lot of coaching. I think that's the most important thing for Quill's development right now.


[sharkH 2]
I'm going to make you an offer. I offer you what you came to ask for 10% of the price. Okay?


[sharkM 2]
I offer you what you came to ask for 9%. Okay? 

[entrepreneurH 1]
Yes.

[sharkM 3]
I also liked it a lot, Marcos. 

[sharkH 3]
I also have another offer for you.

[sharkM 2]
I also have another offer. 300 for what you come to ask for.

[sharkM 5]
I offer you the 300,000 pesos for 10%.

[entrepreneurH 1]
I want to tell you something that is very important to me. Come on. Of course.

Something that I'm looking for and that is very real is to work with someone shoulder to shoulder because I think the issue of sustainability connects them with everyone. What I want to know is, I know there is interest, but how to connect, right? Because I don't know who is related to the paper branch.

There are several branches that are very important, but if you see something that I don't see, I would like to know.

[sharkM 2]
Come on. Now I feel that we are the ones who are on pitch. But what, did we pass there or what?

[sharkH 6]
Daniel, I'm going to help you make decisions. I withdraw my offer. I wish you a lot of success.

I'm out. Thank you. Thank you very much.

[sharkM 4]
I have experience in growing products, in growing images, in making great commercials, and I also get involved a lot with entrepreneurs and they count on me day by day. So I offer you that. Thank you.

Thank you very much.

[sharkM 5]
Daniel, I tell you, I'm not related to the paper branch. I can help you create your company, continue to grow it, commercialize it. I love being involved in projects like yours.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Thank you very much.

[sharkM 2]
Well, I offer you three things. The first is that you are going to have a free focus group with my five daughters, who will surely be users of your product. The second, I have a very broad knowledge of massive consumption and we can apply all that I know about how to create great brands to your brand.

And the third, I am going to provide you with three other R's that are very important for the digital world, which are rankings, ratings and reviews. And I'm going to teach you how to get the best of them.

[entrepreneurH 1]
And we need it.

[sharkH 3]
All that plus selling to a portal of Mexican entrepreneurs, plus almost immediate export, at least to Canada, plus probable funding to enter the American market with this product.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Thank you, Marcos. We also need it. Well, the truth is that I feel very flattered.

Thank you very much. I would like to have them all. But there is something very specific that we are looking for.

And it is the issue of export. So I would like to work with Marcos.

[sharkH 1]
 Do we have a deal?

[entrepreneurH 1]
We have a deal. Great. Thank you, Marcos.
