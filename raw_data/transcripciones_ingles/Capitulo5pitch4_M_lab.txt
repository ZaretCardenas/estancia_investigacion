Being far from Mexico for a long time, who doesn't miss Mexican food? I'm Daniela Barba. And I'm Paola Barba.

And we're here to put you in shoes. No! The Salty Birote is iconic in Guadalajara.

What we did was develop the Salty Birote made with sourdough and we formulated it with our technology, so that it had three months of dry anagel life. Our target market is export. Nostalgia is a market of more than 9 billion dollars annually.

[entrepreneurM 1]
Our company started operations in October 2021. We have had sales for 3 million pesos, with a net utility of 20%. We already have purchase orders.

The most important of them is a chain that is very focused on the Hispanic market. This chain has 389 points of sale throughout the United States. Sharks, we are ready to launch ourselves into the tank in the United States, but we want to do it with the support of the best.

That is why today we are looking for a capital of 2 million pesos for 33% of participation in our company, with option to purchase its shares for a year.

[sharkH 6]
What would the repurchase be like?

[entrepreneurM 1]
With the utility of your 33% plus the utility that is generated.

[sharkH 4]
And we stay in zero?

[sharkM 5]
How many shares do we have to return?

[entrepreneurM 1]
Well, it would be the goal, if not, give us a good counteroffer. 
Are you ready to try a torta ahogada? The first torta ahogada in a long-term package?

[sharkH 5]
Let's see.

[sharkH 4]
I'm hungry.

[sharkM 5]
And they got the best tank, with three tapatios.

[sharkH 5]
It's also complicated because we know about cakes. 

[sharkM 5]
It's true, here Mauri is an expert. 

[sharkH 5]
Official catchers of torta ahogada.

[sharkM 5]
What are you preparing for us there, Daniela? 

[entrepreneurM 1]
Some tapas of torta ahogada.

[sharkM 5]
Right now they are already selling somewhere? 

[entrepreneurM 1]
Organically we are selling in Mexico in food service. 

[sharkM 5]
Okay.

[sharkH 5]
It's very good. Very delicious.

[entrepreneurM 1]
We already have the necessary certifications for the United States, TIF for the issue of meat.

[sharkH 5]
To export the meat?

[entrepreneurM 1]
It is correct.

[sharkM 5]
I have a question. Why is it so difficult to make the birote elsewhere? What makes a good birote?

[entrepreneurM 1]
What makes a good birote?

[sharkH 5]
The secret is between tapat√≠os. 

[sharkH 5]
Don't tell them, don't tell them.

[entrepreneurM 1]
Yes. Really the secret is that the sourdough with the climate of Guadalajara is in a party. So that sourdough makes a sour bread.

[sharkM 5]
And this agent, how much is it going to cost the public in the United States?

[entrepreneurM 1]
The analysis we did of the market marks us a starting price of 13.76 dollars, around 14 dollars, exactly.

[sharkH 5]
14 dollars for the kit?

[entrepreneurM 1]
The kit of Torta Ahogada. 

[sharkH 5]
And how much does this ticket cost you? 

[entrepreneurM 1]
Well, the cost we give to the distributor is 7 dollars.

[sharkM 5]
Already put there in the USA . 

[entrepreneurM 1]
Put there, exactly.

[sharkH 5]
What are your projections for this year?

[entrepreneurM 1]
Our projection for this year is to send three trailers to the week of Torta Ahogada.

[entrepreneurM 1]
They are 15 million pesos in three trailers, with a utility of 25%. Something very important, we have installed production capacity to produce up to 20,000 kits of Torta Ahogada or 40,000 birotes. 

[sharkM 5]
How much each?

[entrepreneurM 1]
Daily.

[sharkM 5]
Daniela and Paula.

[entrepreneurM 1]
Yes.

[sharkM 5]
I'm in. 

[entrepreneurM 1]
That's it, thank you.

[sharkH 5]
But you haven't explained well if you have to return that 33%.

[sharkM 5]
Let's see, explain that to us well.

[sharkH 5]
Hey, that's what I haven't felt.

[sharkM 5]
I would like to enter with Ale, but if we have to return all the shares, I'm not in. 

[sharkM 5]
Explain the repurchase option to us.

[entrepreneurM 1]
The repurchase option, we are looking to buy that 33% in a year with the utilities.

[sharkH 5]
And bye bye .

[sharkM 5]
To what valuation? 

[entrepreneurM 1]
To the valuation that there is on the day of the purchase. 

[sharkM 5]
No, then better leave your money on the mattress.

[sharkM 5]
It's like a loan and advice and we have nothing in exchange. I mean, I love helping entrepreneurs, especially women. But here in the tank, this is to do business.

[entrepreneurM 1]
It would be nice if we had a team of women ready to export a Torta Ahogada.

[sharkH 5]
I'm out.

[sharkM 5]
No, Lichi.

[sharkM 5]
I would join, but no, I wouldn't like to go back. Actions. I mean, take us as lifelong partners, good partners, that we can help you, that we can support you, that we can help you get much further than you have ever dreamed of.

[entrepreneurM 1]
We are ready to hear your counter-proposal.

[sharkM 5]
What bothers me is that I don't like proposals where one loses, so I'm out. 

[entrepreneurM 1]
Okay, okay.

[sharkH 5]
I saw you two very in love with Ale and Marisa, but because I like you very much and I would need you to do this, I'm in too.


[entrepreneurM 1]
Silence. The three of us go in, eleven, eleven, eleven, and we keep our share. When?

Let's see, now.

[sharkM 5]
So far, they have an offer from Amaury, Marisa and me for 33%, for the two million pesos that they come to ask for, but without re-purchase of shares. With the condition that Alejandro Lichi also give it to him.

[sharkH 5]
They had already taken it from us.

[sharkM 5]
If you convince him, I'm in.

[sharkH 5]
If you accepts the offer that Ale makes to them, I go in with them.

[sharkM 5]
The counter-offer is two and a half million for 33% and we buy them 10% a year.

[sharkM 5]
I'm going to make you the counter-offer. Don't raise the valuation. Two million for 33% right now and then we keep the 20%.

Five, five, five and five.

[sharkM 5]
Do we have a deal? We have a deal! Yes!

[entrepreneurM 1]
Yes! Yes! Yes!
