I'm Jorge Millado, and we're the founders of Miu & Mii.

Imagine that you're packing your luggage to go on a trip, and you're packing your favorite toothpaste. But when you arrive at the airport, you have to throw it away because it's the only thing allowed to get on the plane. And guess what?

Now, this tube is one of the more than 1,000,000 tubes of toothpaste that arrive every year to our oceans. Imagine all this plastic as if it were 38 Titanic-type cruises. Our star product is the toothpaste tablet, which doesn't require a plastic container.

It's also 100% water-free in its formulation, which is equivalent to only 15% of its weight compared to a traditional toothpaste. Our sales are mainly through e-commerce. We also have distributors throughout the Mexican Republic.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Sharks, we're currently raising around 8 million pesos, which we invite you to take part in for an investment of 2.5 million for 5% of the company. This is where we'd like to invite you to try it, to get to know it.

[sharkM 4]
Go ahead, Brian, try it.

[sharkH 4]
I'm going to brush my teeth here, okay? You have to brush your teeth.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Look, we have two varieties. One is free of fluoride, and the other is with fluoride. So you can choose the one you like.

[sharkH 4]
And just one?  

[entrepreneurH 1]
Just one.The way you use it is very simple.
You just have to chew the tablet. Then you just have to brush your teeth.

[sharkM 4]
Only this little tablet is equivalent to all my toothpaste. I put it in my mouth and I brush my teeth. 

[sharkH 4]
Okay.

[sharkM 4]
Wow, that's very practical.

[entrepreneurH 1]
How is it, Brian? 

[sharkH 4]
Yes, yes, it's good. And it's interesting because it's very small, right?

[entrepreneurH 1]
Correct. Well, thank you.

[sharkH 4]
Thank you.
It tastes good, doesn't it? Yes, and it's small, like so small.

[sharkM 4]
This is for carrying in your bag, I imagine.

[entrepreneurH 1]
That can you have, Marisa, is the equivalent of 2.1 tubes of toothpaste of 75 milliliters.

[sharkH 4]
And is this an invention of yours? Or is it something that is made in other markets? Or tell us a little more.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Of course.

[sharkH 4]
Because I haven't seen this before.

[entrepreneurH 1]
We started working with powders, compacts, flavors, the ingredients that a paste needs. And that's when we did the first tests, right? We started with a compactor at home, with the team.

We already had a team, so it was manual. Then we moved on to more automatic teams, and well, to how we are right now.

[sharkH 4]
Nobody else do it .

[entrepreneurH 1]
Yes, we have competitors who already make tablets in the United States. And we also make up for these competitors.

[sharkM 4]
And in how many utilities? 

[entrepreneurM 1]
Our gross utility is 76%. Before taxes, it is 52%.And net is 32%.

[sharkM 4]
How long do you estimate, with the sales projections you have, that we, as investors, will be able to have an interesting return on our investment if right now we are entering a valuation of 50 million pesos?

[entrepreneurH 1]
At first, what we are doing right now, in the part of the acceleration program, there may be a first exit. But the idea is not that you want to leave in the first subsequent rise. After 2025, 2026, is when you already see a juicy return on investment.

[sharkM 4]
In 2025, I could expect to have a company with a utility of 1.5 million pesos.

[entrepreneurH 1]
No. The margin is really increasing because part of the investment is to acquire machinery that allows us to multiply the installed capacity we have by 8x. And that greatly reduces the operating cost.

[sharkH 4]
What is the percentage of distribution of each channel? 

[entrepreneurH 1]
90% e-commerce and we share the other 10%. 10% of machinery.

[sharkH 4]
You are assuming, perhaps, that there is no competition. What happens when large companies that have a lot of capital, that are very aggressive, you are contemplating that?

[entrepreneurH 1]
Yes, of course. We want to grow the brand at optimal levels to be even attractive to them and be able to sell a part and that the investments also have a success for that part.

[sharkM 4]
It seems to me that they have a very nice brand. I look at the packages a lot, they are very nice. All the colors, the brand is very nice.

Their valuation seems very high to me. For that reason, I am with them.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Thank you very much.

[sharkM 4]
Are they endorsed by dentists? 

[entrepreneurH 1]
Right now we already have dentists who use it, buy it to sell it to their customers in their consultancies and, in fact, they are also recommending it on their social media.

[sharkM 4]
I would tell you that it is important that if they start to see that toothpaste becomes their main product, maybe they will focus on that and continue to develop toothpaste products. But with these valuations, I am out.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Thank you.

[sharkH 4]
You cannot enter a stage where you still have such high market and commercialization risks without knowing the real competition to such a high valuation because the recovery of money will be very difficult. And that's why I'm out.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Thank you very much.

[sharkH 4]
I liked the product. I think it is something that has a market. Maybe it could be a market that grows.

I think you are in favor in terms of how you communicate the product. I think it's attractive. From my point of view, that's going to be a lot of blood in the water with multinational companies and the competition is going to be brutal.

So that's why I'm out.

[sharkH 4]
I don't know if I agree with Brian. It seems to me that they have a good product. The beauty and skincare industry is projected to have impressive growth in the coming years.

It is also very good that they are valued well because it can be an industry that can grow a lot. It is also a very useful industry. I think they are in the right industry.

Unfortunately, I have a conflict of interest. For that reason, I can't make you an offer. I'm out.

But I wish you a lot of success and I would like to contact you to see if we can do something with Maquila.

[entrepreneurH 1]
Thank you very much.

[entrepreneurM 1]
Thank you very much and good luck.
